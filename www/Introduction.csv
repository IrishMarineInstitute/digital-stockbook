About the Stock Book,"<p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet. It provides the latest scientific advice developed in 2020, which informs fishing opportunities for 2021. The Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute (MI) since 1993 and has evolved considerably over time. It continues to evolve to meet the needs of decision makers and stakeholders while addressing evolving EU and national legislation and policies.</p>

<p>The majority of the scientific advice presented in the Stock Book is formulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). Relevant scientific advice from the EU's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICATT) are also used.</p>

<p>The majority of the ICES scientific advice is released in June each year. This is to facilitate consultation with industry and managers on available fishing opportunities for the coming year. ICES produces the remaining scientific advice in October and November. The STECF may also review the status of or give specific advice on fisheries matters. The Stock Book draws on both the ICES and relevant STECF material and the resultant scientific advice it contains relates to those stocks exploited by the Irish fleet, which are managed under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The provision of scientific advice on fisheries resources is a key pillar of the CFP and informs the basis for the management decisions made under the CFP (e.g. annual fishing opportunities and technical measures). </p>

<p>Scientific fisheries advice is developed by the Marine Institute working with other international scientists, and produced <em>via</em> international organisations such as ICES and ICCAT, and expert committees of the EU such as STECF. This advice is based upon the latest available research, assessments and information on the fisheries resource. It is formulated by consensus, which does not imply unanimity of all experts but allows the expert groups and the international scientific organisations to communicate an advice based on best available science. </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
<p>In 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic had wide ranging impacts on the fishing industry, markets and on the provision of scientific advice. As ICES moved to remote meetings only in March the advice sheets were abbreviated to enable the key elements of the advice to be delivered across the full range of stocks. Sampling and surveys programmes were adapted in line with government guidelines to maintain adequate data collection where possible. The full impact of  Covid-19  disruption on the data for stock assessments will not be obvious until 2021, when these data are used to provide fisheries advice for 2022.</p>
<p>The Stock Book is presented annually to our primary client, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) each December. The information contained within the Stock Book is of vital importance during the annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) negotiations at the various EU Council of Fisheries meetings, but principally at the December Council meeting. It also serves as a valuable reference throughout the year at other fisheries management meetings with the EU. The Stock Book is also of interest to a wider audience, including the fishing industry, marine scientists, managers, environmental NGO's, third level institutes, financial institutions and those with an interest in the status and management of marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland. The Stock Book makes use of many technical terms and acronyms; these are explained the end of the book. The MI meets with stakeholders on a regular basis throughout the year to explain how advice is formulated and to discuss fisheries issues e.g. through the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership forum, which consists of industry representatives, the MI and BIM. The MI also has regular meetings with the environmental NGO's for the same purpose. </p>

<p>The Stock Book is available electronically on the Marine Institute's web site at <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/home"" target=""_blank"">www.marine.ie</a>. and as an interactive app which can be found at <a href=""https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/"" target=""_blank"">https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/</a> . We will endeavour to keep the electronic versions of the Stock Book up to date with any amendments which are released by the advisory authorities after this version goes to print.</p> 

<p>While every effort has been made to ensure that the Stock Book contains the most up-to-date and accurate information, the final ICES, ICCAT, STECF reports and various cited reports should be consulted for the definitive advice. More detailed information on specific stocks is available in the relevant ICES Working Group Reports. Definitive information on TAC areas and quota allocations should be obtained from the official EU Journal. </p>
<h4>Fish Production, Fishing Fleets, Employment</h4>
<p><em>The following information is taken from the latest version of ""Facts and Figures on the Common Fisheries Policy -2020 Edition"" which is available on the EU website (DOI 10.2771/553870).</em></p>

<h4>Fish Production</h4>
<p>The EU accounted for 6,800,582 tonnes of fish production (catches and aquaculture) in 2017, which represents about 3% of global production. The EU had about 6% of global fisheries catches in 2017. Although the EU fleets operate worldwide, EU catches are taken primarily in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Eastern Central Atlantic. The most fished species are Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, sand eel and European sprat, which together account for almost 40% of EU catches. Spain, Denmark, the UK and France account for over half of the catches. </p> 

<h4>Fishing Fleets </h4>
<p>Fleet capacity management is an essential tool for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, and is one of the main objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy. The EU fishing fleet is very diverse, with vessels ranging from under six metres to over 75. The total number of EU fishing vessels in 2019 was 81,253 with a gross tonnage of about 1.55 million tonnes, a combined engine power of 6.07 million kW, and an average age of 29.9 years. Vessels >24m account for 3% of the overall fleet, taking of 64% the gross tonnage. Ireland has 1,924 vessels (2.4% of EU total), with a gross tonnage of 61,156 tonnes (4% of EU total) and an engine power of 179,462  kW (3% of EU total). For the past 22 years, the EU fishing fleet capacity has declined in terms of both tonnage and engine power. Despite enlargements to the EU, the number of EU vessels in 2019 was 81,253, which is 5,505 fewer than in 2013. Healthier stocks contribute to a more sustainable industry. Overall, the EU fleet was profitable in 2019. This consolidates the gradual recovery in recent years, during which both the gross profit and the net profit margin of the fleet have shown an upward trend.</p>

<h4>Employment</h4> 
<p>In several EU regions the fishing sector plays a crucial role in employment and economic activity -in some European coastal communities as many as half the local jobs are in the fishing sector. Employment in the fishing sector tends to be concentrated in a handful of countries. Spain alone accounts for a quarter of total employment, and the four countries with the highest levels of employment (Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal) make up around 65%. In Ireland 2,608 people are employed in fisheries (2017 figure), and 3,138 in processing (2017 figure). </p>

<h4>The Fisheries Resource</h4>
<p>The seas around Ireland are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. Most of the fisheries resources within the area come under the remit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The overall 2020 fishing opportunities (i.e. Total Allowable Catches, TAC's species) for stocks to which the Irish fleet has access to, were 1.18 million tonnes of fish, with an estimated landed value of &#8364 1.62 billion (Figure 1.1). Ireland's total share of these TACs in 2020 amounted to 195,221 tonnes with a value of &#8364 252 million. These figures represent stocks in Areas 6 and 7 as well as other areas and international waters. This economic value is based on 2019 average prices and represents a conservative estimate. Ireland's share of these fishing opportunities for 2020 represents 17% by tonnage and 16% by value.</p>

<p>These values do not include the valuable inshore fisheries (e.g. lobster, whelk) which are not managed using internationally agreed TACs but do come within the remit of the CFP. These inshore fisheries resources represent a very important resource base for the coastal communities around Ireland.</p>  

<p>Ireland's share of a TAC (the Irish quota) varies depending on the stock concerned. Ireland has 86% of the Celtic Sea herring TAC; 69% of the boarfish; 37% of <em>Nephrops</em> in Area 7; 26% of horse mackerel and 21% of mackerel (EU TAC). For other stocks it has a much lower share of the TAC: 8% of anglerfish in Area 7 and 6% of northern hake. </p>

represents a very important resource base for the coastal communities around Ireland.</p>
<p>Ireland's share of a TAC (the Irish quota) varies depending on the stock concerned. Ireland has 86% of the
Celtic Sea herring TAC; 69% of the boarfish; 37% of <em><em>Nephrops</em></em> in Area 7; 26% of horse mackerel and 21% of
mackerel. In other stocks it has a much lower share of the TAC; 8% of anglerfish in Area 7; 26% of Celtic Sea
cod and 6% of northern hake (Figure 1).</p>
","<p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS)
team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish
fleet. It provides the latest scientific advice developed in 2016, that informs fishing opportunities in 2017 . The
Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute since 1993 and has evolved considerably in that time
period. It continues to evolve in a changing fisheries advisory environment.</p>
<p>This year the format of the Stock book has been simplified and made more visual.</p>
<p>The majority of the scientific advice presented in the Stock Book is formulated by the International Council for
the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). Relevant scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic
Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
(ICATT) is also used. In a minority of cases, the Marine Institute may not agree with some aspects of the
scientific advice. In such cases an alternative FEAS advice is given with a clear rationale for this advice.</p>
<p>The majority of the ICES scientific advice is released in June each year. This is to facilitate consultation with
industry and managers on available fishing opportunities for the coming year. ICES produces the remaining
scientific advice in October. The EU's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) may
also review the status of or give advice on certain fish stocks. The Stock Book draws on both the ICES and
relevant STECF material and the resultant scientific advice it contains relates to those stocks exploited by the
Irish fleet that come under the remit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The provision of scientific advice on
the fisheries resource base is a key component to the CFP and forms the basis for the management decisions
made under the CFP (e.g. annual TAC's and technical measures).</p>
<p>The Stock Book contains impartial scientific advice developed by the Marine Institute working with other
international scientists at ICES and STECF. This advice is developed using the latest available research,
assessments and advice on the fisheries resource. It is formulated by consensus.</p>
<p>The function of the Stock Book is to inform management decisions on fishing opportunities for 2017 using the
latest scientific advice.</p>
<p>The Stock Book is presented annually to Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) in
November. The information is of vital importance in serving Ireland during the annual TAC negotiations at the
various EU Council of Fisheries meetings, but principally at the December Council meeting. It also serves as a
valuable reference throughout the year at other fisheries management meetings with the EU. The Stock Book is
also of interest to a wider audience, including the fishing industry, marine scientists, managers, environmental
NGO's, third level institutes, financial institutions and those with an interest in the status and management of
marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland.<p>
<p>While every effort has been made to ensure that the Stock Book contains the most up to date and accurate
information, the final ICES, ICCAT, STECF reports and various cited reports should be consulted for the official
and definitive advice. More detailed information on specific stocks is available in the relevant ICES Working
Group Reports. Definitive information on TAC areas and quota allocations should be obtained from the official
EU Journal.</p>

<h3>The Fisheries Resource.</h3>
<p>The fishing industry in Europe employs 139,023 full time equivalents and has a fishing fleet of 83,014 vessels with
a total gross tonnage of 1.7 million tonnes and engine power of 6.4 million Kilo Watts. The EU represents bout
4.4% of global fisheries and aquaculture production (6,369,756 tonnes) which makes it the fifth producer
worldwide. The overall value of the seafood production sector is around 23 billion euro, which by revenue
comparison, puts the EU seafood industry among the top 250 of the global Fortune 500 companies (source EU
Commission Statistics).</p>
<p>The seas around Ireland are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. Most of
the fisheries resource within the area come under the remit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The overall
2016 fishing opportunities (i.e. Total Allowable Catches, TAC's species) for stocks to which the Irish fleet
has access to, were 1.1 million tonnes of fish, with an estimated landed value of 1.26 billion euro (Figure 1.1).
Ireland's total share of these TAC's in 2016 amounted to 216,261 tonnes with a value of 201 million euro.
These figures represent stocks in Areas 7 and 6 as well as other areas and international waters. This
economic value is based on 2015 average prices and represent a conservative estimate. Ireland's share of
these fishing opportunities for 2016 represents 20% by tonnage and 16% by value.</p>
<p>These values do not include the valuable inshore fisheries (e.g. lobster, whelk) which are not managed using
internationally agreed TACs but do come within the remit of the CFP. These inshore fisheries resource
represents a very important resource base for the coastal communities around Ireland.</p>
Ireland's share of the TAC (the Irish quota) varies depending on the stock concerned. Ireland has 86% of the

mackerel. In other stocks it has a much lower share of the TAC; 8% of Anglerfish in VII; 15% of Celtic Sea cod
and 6% of Northern Hake (Fig. 1.1).</p>

<li> Stock Advice with ICES Advisory Sheets </li></ul></p>

<p>The introduction to the Stock Book gives some general statistics on the fisheries resource, fish production, the fishing fleets and employment for the EU and for Ireland. It also provides an overview of the format of the Stock Book and the approach taken in the formulation of the ICES advice and the EU Commission proposals for fishing opportunities for 2021.</p> 

<p>The Quality and Assurance section details the processes which underpin the quality assurance of data and information produced by the MI upon which scientific fisheries advice is dependent. </p>

<p>The Stock Book provides a summary table on the status, scientific advice and proposed fishing opportunities for 2021 on page 15. This table is used to brief DAFM, Industry and the NGOs on the latest scientific advice and is a valuable summary reference. This table is a summary reference and the individual advice sheets form ICES should be consulted for the details. </p>

<p>The Sustainability Assessment provides information on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators. These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing pressure which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and the spawning stock biomass (SSB) in the year of the assessment in relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment impairment). The evaluation provides one of the main inputs to the Ministers annual sustainability assessment which is presented to the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in late November or early December. </p>

<p>The section on Good Environmental Status (GES) in relation to Commercial Fish Stocks (Descriptor D3) reflects Ireland's second cycle submission under Articles 8,9 and 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in 2020.  This submission follows the original Directive and newly established criteria, elements and methodological standards as set out in Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 and amending Commission Directive (EU) 2017/845. The status of 177 stocks within Ireland's designated MSFD area was assessed. A key finding is that there has been a substantial improvement in fishing mortality, assessed under Criterion D3C1 set out in Commission Decision 2017/848. Of the commercially exploited stocks that were assessed in both cycles, there was an 80% improvement in the fishing mortality criterion. It is concluded that a total of 34 stocks have achieved GES, while the environmental status of 99 stocks is currently unknown. In the case of 44 other stocks, GES is not being achieved.</p>
<p>A summary of the long-term management plans used as a basis for advice are also presented in the Stock Book. This section now deals primarily with the Multi Annual Plan for Western Waters (WWMAP) which is the primary framework for managing demersal stocks which can be caught in mixed fisheries.</p>

<p>The section on mixed fisheries could not be included in the stock book this year because of delays in the delivery of assessments upon which this analysis is developed. This section will be added to the electronic version of the stockbook as soon as the report is released by ICES. The Marine Institute continues to play a key role in the development and delivery of mixed fisheries advice at ICES.</p>

<p>The main part of the Stock Book contains the species information and the individual stock advice. The format is organised by species and then stocks rather than on an area-based approach (e.g. Irish Sea). The species overview provides information on the general biology, national and international landings distributions, Irish landings and values.</p>

<p>The individual stock advice provides a summary of the advice for 2021, outlines key points in relation to the stock (i.e. ICES stock category, Advice Basis; Management Plan options -where relevant; Landing Obligation). The current management of the stock is also summarised and key considerations of relevance to the stock for Ireland is given. The complete ICES advice for the stock is also given.  </p>

<p>This advice is principally based on MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield) considerations or agreed Management Plan considerations. The status of the stock in relation to the landing obligation and management plans are also given. The long-term management plans in place for stocks of Irish interest are shown on page 13.</p> 

<p>The current management section gives information on the past TAC, and describes any mismatches between assessment area and management area and quota allocations by country. The reader will note that there are several instances where the TAC management area does not match exactly with the ICES advice area. This often forms the basis of confusion when seeking to compare the TACs set against the ICES advice. For a useful reference to the correspondence between fishing opportunity proposals and the final agreed TAC, the reader is referred to the European Council website, where the media section usually contains this information after December Council  <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press"" target=""_blank"">www.consilium.europa.eu/media</a>.</p>

<p>The Stock Book also contains a series of annexes which include definitions of the technical terms and acronyms used throughout the text. The ecosystem overview can be found in an annex to the online Stock Book and does not appear in this printed version as it is not due to be updated before this book is printed.</p>

<p>The section on Good Environmental Status (GES) in relation to Commercial Fish Stocks (Descriptor D3) is abbreviated this year. This is because Ireland is in the process of submitting its report on progress towards GES under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) to the European Commission. The material for this section, which forms part of Ireland's MSFD report on GES is undergoing a public consultation at the time of going to print of the Stock Book. Readers interested in the detail of Ireland's MSFD report should review the public consultation documents which can be found on the website of the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (www.housing.gov.ie).</p>
<p>A summary of the long-term management plans used as a basis for advice are also presented in the Stock Book. This section now deals primarily with the Multi Annual Plan for Western Waters (WWMAP) which is the primary framework for managing demersal stocks which can be caught in mixed fisheries.</p>

<p>Mixed Fisheries scenarios for the Celtic Sea in relation to cod, haddock and whiting are also presented. This information produced by ICES formed the basis for a response to special request which the European Commission sent to ICES in order to explore options for managing the bycatch of depleted stocks in mixed fisheries. The work to produce these analyses was supported in a key role by the Marine Institute</p>

<p>The main part of the Stock Book contains the species information and the individual stock advice. The format is organised by species and then stocks rather than on an area-based approach (e.g. Irish Sea). The species overview provides information on the general biology, national and international landings distributions, Irish landings and values.

Rationale,"<p>ICES gives advice in the context of the policy objectives of its clients. Thus ICES advice is based on a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) approach. Where possible ICES provides analytical forecasts with a catch option consistent with F<sub>MSY</sub>(or F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges) for 2021. Where the SSB in 2021 is forecasted to be below the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>, ICES advises on a lower F (scaled by the degree to which biomass in 2020 is below the trigger). For stocks where SSB is below B<sub>lim</sub>and there is no catch option which results in an SSB above B<sub>lim</sub>in the catch year, ICES gives a zero catch advice. In these cases, the Commissions approach has been to set an ""unavoidable"" by-catch TAC's at a low level, because setting TAC's to zero for species which are caught with other stocks would lead to a closure of multiple fisheries with serious socioeconomic impacts.  For stocks where analytical forecasts are not possible ICES provides advice according to a set of procedures that follow the Precautionary Approach to fisheries management. </p>

<p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out its approach to formulating these proposals, which are based on a consultative approach (COM(2020) 248 final): <em> ""Since 2020, fish stocks are to be managed in line with the maximum sustainable yield target. The main objective of the Commission's proposals for the Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea stocks will therefore be to maintain or reach maximum sustainable yield (F<em>MSY</em>) for MSY-assessed stocks 16 . The Commission will fully implement management plans. The Commission will propose either the MSY point value or make use of the MSY range indicated by ICES where this is legally possible under a multiannual plan. Where the ICES recommends that no catches be taken from target stocks, the focus will be on rebuilding these with remedial measures under the multiannual plans. The proposals will also continue to look at ways of facilitating the effective implementation of the landing obligation. Work with all stakeholders continues in order to ensure that stocks covered by these plans get full MSY scientific evaluation as soon as possible.""</em></p> 

<p>FEAS provides the summary below explaining the Commission's approach as outlined in the communications. These considerations are framed around implementing the MSY and landing obligation in the CFP bearing in mind that:
<ol><li> some stocks are subject to negotiations with other parties (Norway and Coastal states)</li>
<li> many demersal stocks are now covered by multi species Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs)</li>
<li> the advice for some stocks is qualitative and they are managed by MSY proxies</li>
<li> there are a small number of by-catch stocks (which will be managed according to PA). </li></ol> </p>

<p>The Commission states that the proposed TACs shall set be in line with ICES scientific advice (COM(2020) 668 final). To take account of the full application of the landing obligation, the Commission proposes TACs on the basis of catch advice instead of previously used landings advice. The proposed Union quotas take account of the fact that certain limited discards based on established exemptions will occur, and thus will not be landed and counted against the quotas.</p>

<p>Due to Brexit the Commission's initial proposals only contain fishing opportunities for two stocks of interest to Ireland.  The stocks for which the Commission will need to consult with the UK on quota shares for fishing opportunities for 2021 and 2022 are therefore presented as pro memoria, pending the outcome of the ongoing negotiations regarding the cooperation on these stocks, including fishing opportunities, quota shares and access to the UK waters (COM(2020) 668 final).</p>

<p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out its approach to formulating these proposals, which are based on a consultative approach. Whereas previously the proposals were based on ""top-ups"" to landings advice, since 2018 the European Commission has said it will subtract <em>de minimis</em> exemptions from the ICES catch advice to generate TAC proposals.</p> 

<p>FEAS provides the summary below explaining the Commission's approach as outlined in the communications ""COM (2018) 452 final"" published on June 11th 2018, and further updated in ""COM (2019) 274 final"" published on 7 June 2019. These documents set out key considerations in the Commissions approach for proposing TACs for 2020. These considerations are framed around implementing the MSY and landing obligation in the CFP bearing in mind that:
<ol><li> some stocks are subject to negotiations with other parties (Norway and Coastal states)</li>
<li> many demersal stocks are now covered by multi species Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs)</li>

<li> there are a small number of by-catch stocks (which will be managed according to PA). </li></ol> </p>

<p>The Commission states that the proposed TACs shall be in line with ICES scientific advice. Where the ICES catch advice is for a large change, the Commission will consider capping large variations on a case-by-case basis in order to phase in the advice and to buffer its impact on TAC setting, whilst respecting the legal framework in place. Furthermore, the points below apply to certain categories of stocks</p>

<ol><li> For stocks that are shared with non-EU countries (straddling stocks), the Commission will continue to seek agreement with other parties while trying to advance the achievement of F<sub>MSY</sub>. However, several of these stocks have, to date, been managed on the basis of agreed long-term management strategies which are not necessarily compatible with achieving F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2020.</li> 
<li> For stocks under MAPs, the TAC proposals are to be set in accordance with the plans. These plans include an F<sub>MSY</sub> range for the stocks listed, whereby the TAC can be set above F<sub>MSY</sub> at the upper part of the range under certain conditions. These conditions require that the stock is above MSYB<sub>trigger</sub> and any of the following apply; that it is necessary from a mixed fisheries consideration; that, on the basis of science advice, it is necessary to avoid harm from intra-species stock dynamics; in order to limit variation in fishing opportunities to 20% between consecutive years.</li> 
<li> For stocks where the assessment is qualitative, the Commission will follow the same approach as for stocks with a quantitative assessment.</li>
<li> For the so called ""statement stocks"" (those implicitly considered as by-catches under the MAPs) the Commission will assess the best approach for the future taking into account: ICES advice; the fact that they represent only 5% of landings under TACs; and the need to avoid choke situations for economically important target fisheries. The management objective for these stocks is the PA approach.</li></ol> </p>

<p>It is still not explicit in the Commission's communication how they will deal with proposing TACs in the cases where there is a high survivability exemption. In principle, this is not the same as the <em>de minimis</em> exemption (for which the proposal is to subtract the <em>de minimis</em> proportion from the ICES catch advice) because not all of the unwanted catch (i.e. discards) are dead when returned to the sea. For certain stocks such as <em>Nephrops</em>, ICES advice does take the survivorship of unwanted catch (i.e. discards) into account and in these cases the most appropriate catch option from the ICES advice on which to base the TAC proposal, would be ""wanted catch"" (i.e. landings).</p>

In these cases, (subsequent to the release of the ICES advice) the Commission asked ICES to estimate for each case of a zero catch advice, the amount in tonnes that would be likely to be caught by operators who fish for other species in the area (bycatch/non-targeted), assuming that the other TACs in the same area would be set based on the latest ICES advice. In this context ICES may revise the way in which it gives advice for stocks below B<sub>lim</sub> in the future. </p>

<p>The Commission states that the proposed TACs shall be in line with ICES catch advice. In the cases where there is a <em>de minimis</em> exemption, the Commission will subtract this from the ICES catch advice (topping-down). Where as a result of a recent benchmark the ICES catch advice is for a large change the Commission will consider capping large variations on a case-by-case basis in order to phase in the advice and to buffer its impact on TAC setting, whilst respecting the legal framework in place.

<p>As outlined in the first paragraph of this section the Commission has requested from ICES what the non-targeted bycatch of stocks - for which ICES had issued a zero catch advice - would be. This would indicate that the Commission intends to propose TAC's for these stocks, based on a non-targeted bycatch provision. </p>
","<p>ICES advice is provided based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY). ICES provides analytical forecasts with a
catch option consistent with F<sub>MSY</sub> for 2018. Where the SSB in 2018 is forecasted to be below the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>,
ICES advises on a lower F scaled by the degree to which biomass in 2018 is below the trigger. For stocks
where analytical forecasts are not possible ICES provides advice according to a set of procedures that follow
the Precautionary Approach to Fisheries Management.</p>
<p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The
Commission has set out its approach to formulating these proposals. In 2018 these proposals are tightly
aligned with ICES advice. FEAS provides the summary below explaining the Commission's approach, and
outlining the communication ''COM (2017) 368 final''.</p>
<p>The overarching approach was published in ''COM (2017) 368 final'' on July 7th 2017. The document sets out 4
key considerations in the way the Commission would initiate TAC proposals for 2017:
<ol><li> Stocks with MSY assessment</li>
<li> Stocks under multiannual plans</li>
<li>Other stocks
<ol type=""A""><li> Stocks with data available to determine MSY proxies</li>
<li> Stocks with survey-based trends or with advice based only on catch time series</li>
<li> 26 stocks where TACs will not be altered (stability)</li>
<li> Stocks without biological advice</li></ol></li>
<li> Stocks coming under the Landing Obligation in 2018</li></ol>
<p>1. For Stocks with MSY assessment, the proposed TACs shall be in line with achieving F<sub>MSY</sub> the following
year (2018). A commitment to set TACs at point estimates of F<sub>MSY</sub> was also contained in last year's proposal.
However that was conditioned by a more general commitment towards achieving that target by 2020. For the
first time, in 2017, the Commission unequivocally seeks F<sub>MSY</sub> in TAC setting in the following year. The
underlying basis of the Commission's approach is Article 2.2 of the 2013 Common Fisheries Policy. This article
states that stocks must be maintained ''above levels which can produce'' MSY. This is a looser interpretation
of MSY than that contained in COM (2017) 368 final.</p>
<p>For stocks that are shared with non-EU countries (straddling stocks), the Commission seeks agreement on the
same basis. However, several of these stocks have, to date, been managed on the basis of agreed long term
management strategies which are not necessarily compatible with achieving F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018. While these
management strategies have been assessed by ICES in terms of compatibility with MSY and the PA,
management strategy features such as constraints on inter-annual TAC change mean that F<sub>MSY</sub> may not be
achievable in 2018.</p>
<p>2. For stocks under multiannual plans, the TAC proposals shall be set in accordance with the plan only if
this achieves harvesting at F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018.</p>
<p>There are also a number of internal EU multiannual plans, with TAC constraints, which do not necessarily
achieve F<sub>MSY</sub> in the following year. These cover various sole stocks and Celtic Sea herring. Only the plans for
North Sea sole and Celtic Sea herring are deemed precautionary by ICES, though the Biscay sole plan was
approved by STECF. All three have been used for TAC setting up to 2017. However for 2018, the
Commission proposals are not following these management plans. It should be noted that the sole plans are
enshrined in legislation, while the Celtic Sea herring plan is not.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the Commission intends to roll out new multi-annual plans for the various sea areas under
its jurisdiction. These long term plans will contain a range of values for F<sub>MSY</sub> per stock, and in general follow the
approach taken for the Baltic Sea multi-annual plan, which the EU adopted in 2016 for the main fish stocks.
This plan was used as a basis for TAC setting for 2017. It was also used as a basis for ICES advice for 2018,though ambiguities in the plan made it difficult for ICES to identify the desired catch option. It is understood
that similar ambiguities exist in the draft plan for North Sea demersal fish.</p>
<p>3A. For stocks with data available to determine MSY proxies, the broad approach from the Commission
will be to follow the advice from ICES in proposing TACs.</p>
<p>3B. For stocks with survey-based trends or with advice based only on catch time series the approach
would be to follow ICES, but on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>3C. For the 26 stocks with TAC stability having been established on a multi-annual basis in 2013, the TAC
proposals will follow previous ones unless there is special advise to do otherwise.</p>
<p>3D. For stocks without biological advice it is not clear what the approach is for TAC setting. However the
Commission is in liaison with ICES to develop suitable advisory products.</p>
<p>4. For stocks coming under the Landing Obligation in 2018, and notwithstanding the provisions 1-3
above, TAC proposals will include uplift to accommodate hitherto legally discarded fish. However there is
stated desire not to increase F or jeopardise the overall F<sub>MSY</sub> objective.</p>
For certain by-catch stocks coming under the Landing Obligation, which would act as choke species, the
Commission will consider removal of TAC control. This approach was already taken for North Sea dab and
flounder in 2017. The Commission has announced its openness to such further proposals, if there is no risk to
the conservation of the stock and if ICES advice is supportive.","<p>ICES advice is provided based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY). ICES provides analytical forecasts with a catch
option consistent with F<sub>MSY</sub> for 2017. Where the SSB in 2017 is forecasted to be below the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>, ICES
advises on a lower F scaled by the degree to which biomass in 2017 is below the trigger. For stocks where
analytical forecasts are not possible ICES provides advice according to a set of procedures that follow the

<ol><li> Stocks with MSY advice, available point estimates of F<sub>MSY</sub> will be used to propose TACs for 2017.</li>
<li> Failure to reach F<sub>MSY</sub> by 2017 will only be countenanced by the Commission in exceptional circumstances
and upon production of socio-economic reasons why drastic reductions in F are unfeasible.v

<li> Stocks with survey-based trends or catch time series only: Commission will use ICES advice, but consider
the particular circumstances of each stock, applying precautionary reductions where deemed necessary.</li>
<li> Stocks without biological advice: The principles of MSY and the Precautionary Approach to Fisheries
Management shall be followed in TAC setting**.</li></ol>
<p>* The following stocks fall into this category: Rockall cod, 6.a sole, 7.bc sole, 7.ef herring, 6.a plaice, 7.bc plaice,

developing the Baltic Seas LTMP as a means to break the inter-institutional deadlock on multi-annual management
plans.</p>
<p>In 2017 the landing obligation will be further entered into force for demersal species in western waters. The
Commission's proposals shall take into account of catches previously discarded, as estimated by ICES. Thus, TACs
will cover total catch and not, as previously, for landings only. ICES advice is now for total catch (landings +
discards). ICES advice and Commission policy are therefore compatible with respect to the landing obligation.
Rolling out of the Landings Obligation will include further TAC adjustments (quota up-lift), including improved
quota swapping strategies and continued limited discarding for stocks with high survival <em>de minimis</em> exemptions,
adjustment of technical measures and the regionalized adaptation of selectivity and avoidance approaches. Quota
uplift calculations will be submitted by the Commission to STECF for approval. In cases where no discard data are
available, the Commission intends to calculate the TAC adjustments on the basis of data extrapolations. It should
be noted that quota uplift will not apply for stocks not falling under the LO until later years.</p>

Sustainability Ass,"<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2021</h3>
<p>FEAS advise that number of sustainably fished stocks has declined slightly to 33 out of 74 or 45%.  The number of stocks with biomasses higher than sustainable trigger reference levels remains the same at 25 or 34%.  There is gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base since 2012.</p><hr/>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>ICES and FEAS evaluate the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.  These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing mortality which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and SSB in the year of the assessment in relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment impairment). FEAS gives an overview of the scientific status and advice on 74 fish stocks, of which Ireland has a share of the TAC in the table presented in the 'Advice Summary' section.</p>

<p>Table 1 summarises the fishing pressure status relative to FMSY on the 74 reference stocks and compares with the same evaluation presented in previous years Stock Books.  There is a slightly lower number of sustainably fished stocks (33) and percentage (45%) in 2020 compared with last year (35 stocks and 47%).  The percentage (18%) and number of stocks (13) overfished has remained the same in 2020 whereas the stocks with unknown status has increased to 28 or 38%.</p>

<p>Table 2 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points with the same evaluation presented last year.  Thirty-four percent or 25 stocks are above MSY biomass trigger points, same as last year.  The number of stocks below the MSY biomass trigger point has decreased slightly to 20% or 15 stocks which are assessed to be below the MSY biomass trigger reference points.  The number of stocks with unknown SSB, no assessments or undefined B<sub>triggers</sub> has increased to 34 (46%) this year.  The reason for this is the downgrading of a number of assessments to a qualitative basis which does not facilitate absolute biomass status evaluation.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons why stocks have unknown status including; short time series of biological data, low catches and/or insufficient sampling data or missing catch information (e.g. angling catches or discards). </p>

<p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in the last seven Stock Books are presented in Table 3.  The stock status as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time.  The trend shows an increasing number of stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> and with biomasses (SSB) above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> since 2012.  This shows gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base.</p>
<p>A list of the 11 stocks where their assessed status has change between the 2019 and 2020 are shown in Table 4.  Four stocks which were sustainably fished last year saw increases in fishing mortality above F<sub>MSY</sub>. These were Rockall haddock, Atlanto-Scandian herring, Labadie <em>Nephrops</em> and saithe in west of Scotland and in the North Sea. Four stocks also showed reductions in fishing mortality to below F<sub>MSY</sub>; Haddock west of Scotland and in the North Sea, mackerel, <em>Nephrops</em> at the Smalls and whiting in the Celtic Sea.  Benchmarks assessments downgraded two stocks, sole 7.hjk and whiting 6.a, which were sustainably fished last year to unknown status this year.</p>
<p>The updated assessment for sole in the Irish sea showed a recovery of the stock above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. The status of SSB in relation to reference points changed to unknown for five other stocks.  One stock declined below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> in 2002, <em>Nephrops</em> in FU22. The benchmark for and sole 7.hjk also downgraded the stock status for SSB in relation to trigger levels to unknown.</p>
                                                                          
","<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2020</h3>
<p>FEAS advise that number of sustainably fished stocks has increased to 35 out of 74 or 47% which is the highest since 2012.  The number of stocks with biomasses higher than sustainable reference levels has decreased slightly to 25 or 34%.  There is gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base.</p><hr/>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>ICES and FEAS evaluate the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.  These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing mortality which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and SSB in the year of the assessment in relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment impairment). FEAS gives an overview of the scientific status and advice on 72 fish stocks, of which Ireland has a share of the TAC on pages 15 and 16.</p>

<p>Table 1 summarises the pressure on the 74 reference stocks and compares with the same evaluation presented in previous years Stock Books.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks (35) and percentage (47%) in 2019 compared with last year. The percentage (18%) and number of stocks (13) overfished has decreased in 2019 whereas the stocks with unknown status has remained the same at 26 or 35%.</p>

<p>Table 2 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points with the same evaluation presented last year.  Thirty-four percent or 25 stocks are above MSY biomass trigger points.  This is a slight decline over the past 2 years.  The number of stocks below the MSY biomass trigger point has decreased slightly and 20% of stocks are assessed to be below the biomass reference point which is required to deliver MSY.  The number of stocks with unknown SSB, no assessments or undefined B<sub>trigger</sub> has increased to 34 (46%) this year. The reason for this is the downgrading of a number of assessments to a qualitative basis which does not facilitate absolute biomass status evaluation.</p>

<p>There are multiple reasons why stocks have unknown status including; short time series of biological data, low catches and/or insufficient sampling data or missing catch information (e.g. angling catches or discards). Over time the percentage of stocks with unknown pressure and state indicators has been declining. However, over the past number of years inconsistent signals in the abundance of specific year classes in certain stocks has led to difficulties in assessments which can be manifest as biased results. The reasons for this can be complex, and ICES is engaged in resolving these recent occurrences. It is likely that for some stocks these will remain with unknown pressure or state category and the management and advisory framework should take that into account.</p>

<p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in the last seven Stock Books are presented in Table 3.  The stock status as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time.  A list of the 13 stocks where their assessed status has change between the 2018 and 2019 are shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>An updated assessment of Cod in the Irish Sea showed a persistent bias. For this reason, the assessment was downgraded to a status where qualitative indicators from the surveys were used to give an advice. The qualitative assessment is not able to estimate where the stock biomass is in relation to MSY biomass reference points, but it is considered that fishing pressure is still below F<sub>MSY</sub>. This is a similar outlook for herring to the west of Scotland and Ireland (6 & 7bc), where the assessment is downgraded to a qualitative basis where the status in relation to biomass reference points is now unknown.</p>
<p>The updated assessment for herring in 1 & 2 shows that fishing mortality has reduced and is now below F<sub>MSY</sub>. This is the same outlook for megrim in the Celtic sea and west of Ireland.</p>
<p>The fluctuation of <em>Nephrops</em> stocks around reference points continues, and may reflect uncertainty (noise) in the measurement in some cases.  Fishing mortality in FU 13 & FU 16 decreased below F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018 although for FU22 the fishing mortality increased above F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018.  The biomass in FU22 increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> in 2018, but the biomass in FU17 decreased below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>.</p>
<p>A new benchmarked assessment for Sole in 7fg, has revised the fishing mortality downwards, such that it is now considered below F<sub>MSY</sub>. On the other hand further west for sole 7hjk, the biomass has been declining for a number of years and is now considered to be below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. Similarly the biomass for western horsemackerel has been declining over a number of years and it too is considered in 2019 to be below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. </p>                                                                             
","<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2019</h3>
<p>FEAS advise that number of sustainably fished stocks has increased to 32 out of 74 or 43% which is the highest since 2012.  The number of stocks with biomasses higher than sustainable reference levels has decreased slightly to 26 or 35%.  There is gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base.</p><hr/>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>ICES and FEAS evaluate the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.  These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing mortality which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and SSB in the year of the assessment in relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment impairment). FEAS gives an overview of the scientific status and advice on 72 fish stocks, of which Ireland has a share of the TAC on pages 14 and 15.</p>

<p>Table 1 summarises the pressure on the 74 reference stocks and compares with the same evaluation presented in previous years Stock Books.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks (32) and percentage (43%) in 2018 compared with last year.  The percentage (22%) and number of stocks (16) overfished has decreased in 2018 whereas the stocks with unknown status declined again from 28 to 26 or 38% to 35%.</p>

<p>Table 2 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points with the same evaluation presented last year.  Thirty-five percent or 26 stocks are above biomass trigger points.  This is about the same as last year.  The number of depleted stocks has increased slightly and 22% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown SSB, no assessments or undefined B<sub>trigger</sub>s has remained the same at 43% this year.</p>

<p>Over time the percentage of stocks with unknown status has been declining.  There are multiple reasons why stocks have unknown status including; short time series of biological data, low catches and/or insufficient sampling data or missing catch information (e.g. angling catches or discards).  ICES have been developing so called ""data limited assessment methodologies"" to try to estimate stock status for these data limited stocks.  It is likely that for some stocks will remain in this unknown status category and the management and advisory framework should take that into account.</p>

<h3>Detailed Analysis </h3>
<p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in the last seven Stock Books are presented in Table 3.  The stock status as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time.  A list of the 12 stocks where their assessed status has change between the 2017 and 2018 are shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>Separate assessments of the 2 species of anglerfish in 7 & 8 (<em>Lophius piscatorius</em> and <em>Lophius budagessa</em>) show that both species are fished sustainably, and that white bellied anglergfish (<em>L. piscatorius</em>) has a good stock status, whilst that of black bellied anglerfish is unknown as MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> has not been defined for this stock yet. 
An updated assessment of Cod in the Irish Sea has revised the SSB estimate downwards, moving the biomass status of that stock back to below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> in 2018. It is important to note that this is not a deterioration in the stock in 2018 versus 2017, but rather that the assessment process has re estimated the stock biomass trajectory over time (as happens every year through stock assessment) and now shows a trajectory which has not increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>, since the decline in the late 1980's. </p>
<p>A revision of reference points alongside the updated assessment for herring in 1 & 2 shows that fishing mortality continues to increase and is now above F<sub>MSY</sub>, but the new lower MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point means that the stock biomass status has been above the new safe biomass level since the late 1980's. </p>
<p>The fluctuation of <em><em>Nephrops</em></em> stocks around reference points continues, and may reflect uncertainty (noise) in the measurement in some cases.  Fishing mortality in FU 17 & FU 22 decreased below F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2017 although for FU16 the fishing mortality increased above F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2017.  The biomass in FU17 increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> in 2017 (as expected), but the biomass in FU19 & FU22 decreased below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>.</p>
<p>The revised assessment for sea bass (benchmarked in 2017) showed fishing mortality now below F<sub>MSY</sub>, although the biomass is increasing it still remains below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>.</p>

","<h3>FEAS Advice for 2018</h3>
<p>FEAS advise that number of sustainably fished stocks has increased to 29 out of 74 or 39% which
is the highest since 2012. The number of stocks with biomasses higher than sustainable
reference levels has also increased to 27 or 36% which is also the highest since 2012. There is
gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base.</p><hr/>

TAC on pages 12 and 13.</p>
<p>Table 1 summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2017 Stock Book and compares with
the same evaluation presented in previous years Stock Books. There is a higher number of sustainably
fished stocks (29) and percentage (39%) in 2017 compared with last year. The percentage (23%) and
number of stocks (17) overfished has also increased in 2017 whereas the stocks with unknown status
declined slightly from 31 to 28 or 42% to 38%.</p>
<p>Table 2 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points
with the same evaluation presented last year. Thirty-six percent or 27 stocks are above biomass trigger
points. This is a significant increase compared with last year. The number of depleted stocks declined
from 18 to 15 and now 20% of stocks are assessed to be depleted. The number of stocks with unknown
SSB, no assessments or undefined B<sub>trigger</sub>s has declined from 45% last year to 43% this year.</p>
<p>Over time the percentage of stocks with unknown status has been declining. There are multiple reasons

<h4>Detailed analysis</h4>
<p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing
rates and biomass levels as given in the last six Stock Books are presented in Table 3. The stock status
as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time. A list of the 16 stocks where their assessed status has
change between the 2016 and 2017 are shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>Albacore and blue fin tuna are in better condition than last year. Albacore is now estimated to be above
B<sub>MSY</sub> and biomass in blue fin rebuilding although its exact status in relation to B<sub>MSY</sub> remains unknown.
Irish Sea cod was benchmarked in 2017 and the new assessment estimates biomass to have recovered
above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> for the first time since the early 1990s and F is estimated to be well below F<sub>MSY</sub>. For
North Sea and 6.a haddock biomass has increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> having dropped below last year.</p>
<p>There was a change to the ICES assessment for herring in 1 & 2 which saw a large downward revision in
SSB to below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. Celtic Sea herring has been declining recently and the latest assessment shows
a large increase in fishing mortality and an SSB that is below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. The new assessment for ling
indicates that the stock is sustainably fished although biomass reference points are not yet defined.</p>
<p>Some of the <em><em>Nephrops</em></em> stocks have fluctuated around reference points. The stocks in FU 19, FU 22 and
FU13 have increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. Fishing mortality in FU 17, FU 13 and FU 22 increased above
F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2016 although for FU 22 it is expected that fishing mortality in 2017 will decline below again due
to the large abundance increase estimated in 2017. Fishing mortality in FU15 declined below F<sub>MSY</sub> for the
first time in a few years.</p>
<p>Data limited assessment methodologies were used to estimate that F in North Sea horse mackerel was
above any F<sub>MSY</sub> proxies for the first time. Similarly, for plaice in the Celtic Sea (7.fg) a data limited
assessment was used to classify F as below F<sub>MSY</sub> and biomass to be above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. A data limited MSY
B<sub>trigger</sub> proxy was defined for the first time for sole in 7.hjk and the stock is estimated to be above that
level.</p>
","<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>ICES and FEAS evaluate the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.
These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing mortality
which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and SSB in the year of the assessment in
relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment
impairment). In Table 1.6 on pages 14 and 15, FEAS gives an overview of the scientific status and
advice on 76 fish stocks, of which Ireland has a share of the TAC.</p>
<p>Table 1.2 summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2016 Stock Book and
compares with the same evaluation presented in the Stock Book last year. There is a higher number
of sustainably fished stocks (28) and percentage (38%) in 2016 compared with last year. The
percentage and number of stocks overfished has declined in 2016 though the number and
percentage of stocks with unknown status is similar to last year.</p>
<p>Table 1.3 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger
points with the same evaluation presented last year. Thirty-five percent or 22 stocks are above
biomass trigger points. The number of depleted stocks has increased from 14 to 18 and now 25% of
stocks are assessed to be depleted. The number of stocks with unknown SSB, no assessments or
undefined B<sub>trigger</sub>s has declined from 53% last year to 46% this year. There are several different
reasons why this may be the case:
<ul><li> Some stocks are very relatively small and sampling is insufficient to support traditional
assessment approaches e.g. Plaice and Sole in 7.bc, 6.a, Pollock in 6.</li>
<li> Some have uncertain assessment data for biological or stock identity/mixing reasons (e.g.
anglerfish in 7, Pollock in 7, Sprat, Plaice and Sole in 7.hjk)</li>
<li> The absolute level of catch is an issue for stocks with high discards (e.g. Whiting in 6.a and
7.a, Plaice in 7.a and 7.fg), where several species are landed together (e.g. rays) or where
there are other catches (e.g. angling in the case of Pollock)</li>
<li> For other stocks the time series of data is too short to properly define B<sub>trigger</sub> levels.</li></ul></p>
<p>Over time the percentage of stocks with unknown status has been declining but it is likely that for
some stocks problems will remain and the management and advisory framework should take that
into account.</p>

<p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable
fishing rates and biomass levels as given in the last five stock books presented in Table 1.4. The
stock status as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time. The main changes between the 2015 and
2016 Stock Books are presented in Table 1.5.</p>
<p>The main change of note is that Raja brachyura 6 & 4.a and Raja undulata 7.d,e have been added to
the tables this year. ICES have defined new reference points for many of the stock since last year
and this has resulted in a status change for some stock (ICES, 2016a and ICES, 2015b). For example
new MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>s have been defined for FU 19 and 22. New proxy reference points were defined for
Haddock in 7.a, Megrim in 7.b, Plaice in 7.a and 7.hjk, Whiting in 7.a. The stock status for some of
the ray stocks has changed to unknown.</p>
<p>There is new category 1 assessment for Megrim 7.b-k & 8.abde for the first time. Haddock in 6, 3.a
and 6.a has changed from sustainably fished last year to above F<sub>MSY</sub> this year and above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>
last year to below in 2016. Hake is now fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>. Western Horse Mackerel is now fished
below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. Saithe in 6 and 4 is now above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>.</p>","<h4>Summary</h4>
<p> ICES and FEAS evaluate the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.  These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing mortality which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and SSB in the year of the assessment in relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment impairment).  In Table 1.6 on pages 14 and 15, FEAS gives an overview of the scientific status and advice on 72 fish stocks, of which Ireland has a share of the TAC.  </p>

<p> Table 1.2 summarises the pressure on the 72 stocks dealt with in the 2015 Stock Book and compares with the same evaluation presented in the Stock Book last year.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks (26) and percentage (36%) in 2015 compared with last year.  The percentage and number of stocks overfished has declined in 2015 though the number and percentage of stocks with unknown status is similar to last year.  </p>

<p> Table 1.3 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points with the same evaluation presented last year.   Around a quarter or 20 stocks are above biomass trigger points.  The number of depleted stocks has increased from 12 to 14 and now 19% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown SSB, no assessments or undefined B<sub>trigger</sub>s remains relatively high at 53%.  There are several different reasons why this may be the case:
<ul><li> Some stocks are very relatively small and sampling is insufficient to support traditional assessment approaches e.g. Plaice and Sole in VIIbc, VIa, Pollock in VI.</li>
<li> Some have uncertain assessment data for biological or stock identity/mixing reasons (e.g. megrim in VII, anglerfish in VII, Pollock in VII, Sprat, Plaice and Sole in VIIhjk)</li>
<li> The absolute level of catch is an issue for stocks with high discards (e.g. Whiting in VIa and VIIa, Plaice in VIIa and VIIfg), where several species are landed together (e.g. rays) or where there are other catches (e.g. angling in the case of Pollock)</li>
<li> For other stocks the time series of data is too short to properly define B<sub>trigger</sub> levels (e.g. <em><em>Nephrops</em></em> Stocks).</li></ul></p>
<p>Over time the number of stocks with unknown status should decline but it is likely that for some stocks problems will remain and the management and advisory framework should take that into account.</p>
<h4>Detailed analysis</h4>
<p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in the last four stock books presented in Table 1.4.  The stock status as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time.  The main changes between the 2014 and 2015 Stock Books are presented in Table 1.5.  The main change of note is that following a benchmark Herring in VIaN has been merged with the Herring stock in VIIaS and VIIbc.  This new stock is labelled as Herring VIaN, VIIaS and VIIbc which is the reason the number of stocks has declined from 73 to 72.  The assessment on the merged stock also results in a change in status.</p>
<p>Blue whiting, mackerel and <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em> in FU13 have been revised from being sustainably fished to being over exploited. Boarfish has been revised from being sustainably fished to having unknown status, while Whiting in the Irish Sea has gone from over exploited to unknown status. <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em> FU19, Sole VIIa and Western Horse mackerel IIa IVa VI VIIa-c,e-k VIII are now classified as sustainably fished .  Celtic Sea cod has decreased below the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. New MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> values have been defined for <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em> FU14 and FU17 and Whiting in VIa following benchmark assessments at ICES.  Haddock VIb and Herring in the NE Atlantic I II have increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>.</p>

DataQuality,"<p>Data quality and assurance are critical components of the scientific advisory process and are the responsibility of individual member states (e.g. Ireland) and the providers of advice (e.g. ICES). They must work together to ensure that data collection, stock assessments and the formulation of advice are quality assured and free from errors. Ireland takes data quality and assurance very seriously and has developed a data strategy and policy to ensure this is achieved. The MI's Data Management Quality Management Framework (DM-QMF) is used to guide all of its data management processes including collection, storage, quality control, provision and statutory reporting.  As a result of the DM-QMF the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE ) have awarded the MI the status of an Accredited Data Centre. The objective of the DM-QMF is to ensure that the data products that the Marine Institute deliver to the providers of advice are error free and of high quality. </p>

<p>The MI's Data Management Quality Management Framework consists of 3 key elements: 
<ol><li> A Manual - Data Management Quality Management Framework Manual - detailing how the framework operates within the Marine Institute</li>
<li> A Model - Visual representation of the activities described in the Manual (See figure below). </li>
<li> An Implementation Pack - A series of templates and guidelines to implement what is described by the Manual. </li></ol></p>

<p>This framework encourages and supports continual improvement of the quality of the delivered data products and services by assuring the quality of the processes and procedures used in the generation of data or data products. </p>
<p>The MI also collaborates closely with other member states through the EU Regional Coordination Groups (RCG) and they have created a pan-regional sub-group with Terms of Reference that include identifying and promoting best practices, and finding common approaches to measuring and improving data quality. </p> 

<p>ICES is the key scientific advice provider for EU fisheries management. It has a number of ongoing initiatives to assure quality of data, stock assessments and advice. The ICES Advice Plan includes assuring quality as the first key priority area.  The tasks planned include: 
<ol><li>  Mapping process flows and critical control points and feedback loops in the advisory system and begin to address identified critical control points as part of the Quality Assurance Framework (QAF).</li>
<li> Developing comprehensive ICES quality management including the Regional Database and Estimation System (RDBES) and the Transparent Assessment Framework (TAF) - this should allow for fully reproducible assessments and advice calculations.</li>
<li> Where possible, ensure that all advice products are based on data that adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-useable).</li>
<li> Develop and apply the benchmarking system to ensure that it is fit for evolving advisory demands.  </li>
<li> Published frameworks and guidelines for production of the advice.</li>
<li> Many expert groups and training courses etc. have ToRs associated with improving the quality of the advice product e.g. WKFORBIAS, WKGMSE2, WKCOSTBEN, PGDATA.</li></ol></p>
<p>ICES is also preparing for international accreditation for its data management system. ICES has undertaken to make key investments in several of the processes outlined above over the next few years, as part of its commitment to quality. As the demand for detailed scientific information to support public policy increases, ICES strives to meet that need in an open and transparent way, and is constantly seeking to improve its performance. To this end, ICES is engaged in a process of continual learning where it reviews its performance in relation to the quality of the advice it delivers as it seeks to improve outcomes. </p>

LongTermManagement plans,"<p>Several of the stocks of interest to Ireland are or have been managed under Long Term Management plans. Details on these plans are given in the table below. Historically, the process of formulation and adoption of these plans has required scientific input to generate and test a harvest control rule (HCR) which is used as part of the management plan to set the TAC. These plans were proposed by the competent management authority (Commission), tested for adherence to the precautionary approach by ICES and then could be adopted by the management authority (Council). </p>

<p>Following the Lisbon treaty, which introduced co-decision making between the Parliament Council and the Commission, the development and adoption of management plans slowed down as the institutions tried to agree the competencies which were to be shared under co-decision making. Since 2016 the Commission has developed multiannual sea basin plans for demersal species caught together in multi species fisheries. The sea basin plans have been adopted already for the Baltic Sea (2016/1193), and the North Sea (2016/0238), and in 2019 for the Atlantic area which is referred to as Western Waters (2019/472). These plans are commonly referred to as Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). </p>

<p>The MAPs set out to achieve the objectives of the CFP, facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation and promote a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities. They were drafted to be coherent with the MSFD (2008/56), and the Birds Directive (2009/147). Unlike previous management plans which laid out a TAC setting rule, the principle of the MAPs is to implement the MSY policy adopted under the CFP, following best scientific advice. This is done whilst having due regard to the fact that many species are caught together, and that some of the species caught by the fisheries are not targeted but by-catches. Implementing the principles has meant: that target species are identified under the plans (species not listed as target are implicitly considered as bycatches); that TACs are set on target species within a range about F<sub>MSY</sub>, but the upper part of the range can only be used under the conditions set out in the MAPs. Non target by-catches are managed not to optimise yield but to prevent harm in the context of the Precautionary Approach. </p>
<p>Because ICES gives advice in the context of the policies of its clients, ICES advice for many demersal stocks of interest to Ireland are now given in the context of the Western Waters MAP.  The framework for providing advice is given below. It should be noted that ICES also applies an advice rule when stock fall below a MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point. This implies that the F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are scaled when the SSB is below MSYB<sub>trigger</sub> (by SSB/MSYB<sub>trigger</sub>). It should also be noted that when no F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are available ICES defaults to a PA approach for the advice. This is the case for several target stocks in the MAPs such as Pollock.</p>
<p>The applicable advice basis is dependent on the following series of points: 
<ul><li> Is the stock listed in an EU MAP
<li> Is there a range (upper and lower values) defined for the stock
<li> In the assessment of the stock, is spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the MSYB<sub>trigger</sub> reference point
<li> Is the SSB above the B<sub>lim</sub> reference point
<li> If there is no catch option to bring SSB above B<sub>lim</sub> in the catch advice year, zero catch advice is given.</li></ul> </p>
