"1","Summary","<p> In 2016 ICES produced ecosystem overviews for four European ecoregions. These overviews provide a description of the ecosystems, identify the main human pressures, and explain how these pressures affect key ecosystem components. The Celtic Seas ecoregion overview, which covers the whole Irish EEZ including the West of Scotland, the Malin Shelf, the Irish Sea, and the Celtic Sea, is included in this section. </p> <p> The five most important pressures in the Celtic Seas ecoregion are selective extraction of species, abrasion, smothering, substrate loss, and nutrient and organic enrichment. These pressures are linked mainly to the following human activities: fishing, aquaculture, coastal construction, land-based industry, maritime transport, agriculture, dredging, and offshore structures for renewable and non-renewable energy sources. </p> <p> Figures more specific to Irish fisheries are included before the ICES overview. In general, relative fishing pressure has declined in the last ten years while relative spawning stock biomass has remained stable. In 2015/2016: <li> 35% of stocks were fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> (53% unknown) </li> <li> 30% of stocks have SSB above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (54% unknown) </li> <li> 20% of landings came from stocks fished above F<sub>MSY</sub> </li> <li> 96% of landings came from stocks having SSB above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> </li> </p>","<p> In 2016 ICES produced ecosystem overviews for four European ecoregions.

"2","Considerations","FEAS advises that the following considerations should be taken into account when developing ecosystem based management objectives: <li> Fishing has impacted a number of commercial species, with some commercial species such as cod and whiting in the Irish Sea now being considered collapsed. A cod long term management plan is currently in place. </li> <li> Demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, West of Scotland and Rockall are mixed fisheries, catching a large number of commercial and non-commercial species. Many of the species caught are discarded. Mixed fisheries do not only affect the commercial stocks that are presented in this Stock Book, but impact on the wider fish community. </li> <li> The ICES mixed fisheries advice for the Celtic Sea (7.b-c and 7.e-k) is included at the end of this section. However, ICES does not recommend specific mixed-fisheries catch opportunities as no mixed-fisheries management objectives are available. </li> <li> Discarding rates are also high on many commercial species in these areas. Recently introduced technical measures such as increased cod-end mesh size and square mesh panels in the Celtic Sea need to be monitored in order to evaluate their effectiveness. Certain demersal quota species are now subject to the demersal landing obligation. </li> <li> Demersal trawling impacts on benthic habitats and their communities. The resilience and recoverability of habitats varies depending on substrate type, biota and type of fishing gear. The overall impact of demersal trawling on the seabed needs to be evaluated in relation to the proportion of different habitats impacted (see Fig. 5.1.4 in ICES Ecosystem Overview). </li> <li> A number of rare endangered and/or vulnerable species of cetaceans, seals, seabirds and elasmobranchs are resident or transient in Irish waters. The management of fisheries needs to ensure that the conservation of these species is not compromised.</li> <li> Pelagic fish species such as herring, blue whiting, mackerel and horse mackerel are keystone food web species and changes in their abundance can have significant consequences up the marine food chain. </li> <li> Due to their low reproductive output and longevity, many deep-water fish species are very vulnerable to overfishing. High levels of exploitation have led to the depletion of many deep-water fish stocks in ICES subareas 6 and 7. </li> <li> NEAFC and the EU have already closed a number of areas on the Rockall Bank, the Hatton Bank, the Porcupine Bank and the western European Slope to bottom impacting fishing gear, where cold water corals are known to occur. The UK is also in the process of establishing MPAs in a number of deep-water sites such as Rosemary Bank Seamount, Anton Dohrn, and The Canyons. Furthermore, the proposed EU deep-sea trawling ban, which could begin as early as January 2017, will restrict fishing below 800m with mobile bottom contacting gears. </li> <li> Deepwater species are dependent on nutrient input from the upper ocean layers via planktonic snow, mesopelagic species and fall of carcasses. This should be taken into account when considering the development of commercial fisheries for mesopelagic species. </li> <li> In order to implement the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAFM), fisheries management should incentivise fishing behaviour and introduce management tools that reduce the impact of fishing on the wider ecosystem. </li>","FEAS advises that the following considerations should be taken into account when developing ecosystem based management objectives: <li> Fishing has impacted a number of commercial species, with some commercial species such as cod West of Scotland and whiting in the Irish Sea now being considered collapsed. </li> <li> Demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, West of Scotland and Rockall are mixed fisheries, catching a large number of commercial and non-commercial species.

The individual measures should as a whole aim to ensure that environmental targets are addressed and good environmental status (GES) is achieved or maintained by 2020.</p> <p>On 31 July 2018, the Commission adopted its report assessing these programmes, identifying whether they constitute an appropriate framework within the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and whether they address the pressures that the EU seas and oceans are facing. The Commission concluded that while considerable efforts have been made by Member States, not all pressures are covered properly by the measures. The Commission therefore provided recommendations to Member States to guide them in accordance with Article 16 of the Directive.</p> <p>European Commission DGENV has taken note of progress towards rolling out Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the EU has committed to ensure the conservation of 10% of its coastal and marine areas by 2020. In 2012, 5.9 % of Europe's seas had already been designated as marine protected areas, and work is continuing with a view to achieve 10 % coverage by 2020. This objective is also reflected in Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Commission aims to work with Member States to designate, manage and control marine protected areas through financing mechanisms such as the LIFE Programme and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, while promoting inclusive governance structures for and research on marine protected areas.</p> <h3>MSFD Descriptor D3 (Commerical Fish and Shellfish)</h3> <p>ICES and the MI have conducted stock assessments giving results for D3C1 and D3C2 and have recently developed MSY proxies for some data limited stocks (those without full analytic assessments). ICES advises that the GES assessment for the MSFD D3 should be based on criteria D3C1 (Fishing Mortality) and D3C2 (Spawning Stock Biomass) i.e. Category 1 and 2 advice types. However, the Commission Decision 848/2017 gives further guidance on how to handle stocks for which ICES advice is unavailable, and this guidance was followed in the following assessment.</p> <p>ICES advises that the aggregation of the assessment results of criteria D3C1 and D3C2 by stock should be done such that only if both criteria are met will GES be achieved for that stock. This is sometimes referred to as the ""one out all out"" method.</p> <p>ICES advises that the data currently collected on fish length for stock assessment purposes is suitable to assess the size distribution of a stock (D3C3) but that until the proof of concept has been validated, D3C3 be considered as a surveillance indicator for size distribution.</p> <h3>Second Irish D3 Assessment Of Criteria Elements D3C1, D3C2 AND D3C3 Extraction Of, Or Mortality/Injury To, Wild Species Including Target And Non-Target Species, As Presented To The European Commission In 2020</h3><p>An updated assessment has now been carried out with respect to the original Marine Strategy Framework Directive and newly established criteria, elements and methodological standards as set out in Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 and amending Commission Directive (EU) 2017/845. </p> <p>For details on the GES assessment of D3 and other indicators under the MSFD please refer to the documents under <a href&#8805 ""https://www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-quality/marine-strategy/marine-strategy-framework-directive-200856ec-article-17-update"" target&#8805 ""_blank"">https://www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-quality/marine-strategy/marine-strategy-framework-directive-200856ec-article-17-update</a></p> <p>The assessment follows the DPSIR Framework and its applicability for MSFD Cycle 2 is outlined here for clarity.</p> <p><em>Insert Table Here</em></p><p><em>The final version of this assessment, as submitted to the European Commission, in 2020 is presented below:</em></p> <h3>Key Message</h3> <p>In 2013, Ireland completed an initial assessment of its maritime area, under the 2008 Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; Directive 2008/56/EC). An updated assessment has now been carried out with respect to the original Directive and newly established criteria, elements and methodological standards as set out in Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 and amending Commission Directive (EU) 2017/845. </p> <p>In relation to populations of all commercially-exploited fish and shellfish species, the status of 177 stocks within Ireland's designated MSFD area was assessed. A key finding is that there has been a substantial improvement in fishing mortality, assessed under Criterion D3C1 set out in Commission Decision 2017/848. Of the commercially exploited stocks that were assessed in both cycles, there was an 80% improvement in the fishing mortality criterion. It is concluded that a total of 34 stocks have achieved GES, while the environmental status of 99 stocks is currently unknown. In the case of 44 other stocks, GES is not being achieved.</p> <h3>Background</h3> <p>Fisheries that occur in Ireland's maritime area are managed both under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and nationally for stocks not subject to the EU quota regime. This assessment covers all criteria elements under MSFD D3. The assessment covers both stocks managed under the CFP and those managed nationally, which are fished in Irish MSFD waters. Many of these stocks straddle the boundary between Ireland and other jurisdictions, while some are exploited in Irish waters, but not by Irish vessels. The relevant criteria for inclusion of stocks in the assessment are based on Commission Decision 848/2017, as follows: <ol type&#8805 ""a""><li> all stocks that are managed under Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013; <li> the species for which fishing opportunities (total allowable catches and quotas) are set by Council under Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; <li> the species under multiannual plans according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013; <li> any important species on a regional or national scale for smallscale/local coastal fisheries.</li></ol></p> <h3>Objective</h3> <p>Irelands Initial Assessment (2013) described the characteristics of Good Environmental Status (GES) for populations of commercial fish and shellfish as follows: Populations of commercially exploited fish and shellfish are within safe biological limits. Stocks of commercially exploited fish and shellfish species are exploited at levels which ensure long term sustainability and maintenance of sufficient reproductive capacity. Populations exhibit a healthy composition with regard to age and size distribution. Consistency to be maintained in accordance with the progressing reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, The associated targets outlined in the Initial Assessment (2013) were as follows: <ul><li> Target fishing mortality to be at levels which aim to restore and maintain populations of harvested species at least at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), by 2015, where possible. Where stocks are managed within an agreed management plan, which is consistent with MSY in the long term, target fishing mortality as specified by the management plan should be adhered to; <li> Target fishing mortality to be at levels which aim to restore and maintain populations of harvested species at least at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, by 2020, for all stocks. Where stocks are managed within an agreed management plan, which is consistent with MSY in the long term, target fishing mortality as specified by the management plan should be adhered to; <li> Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) should be within the range of biomasses which would be expected under fishing mortality equal to or below FMSY in the medium to long term and incorporate scientific uncertainty and natural variability; <li> Size and age structure as measured by selected indicators reflect populations which are sustainably fished in the medium to long term and incorporate scientific uncertainty and natural variability.</li></ul></p> <p>The environmental targets from the Initial Assessment (2013) have now been updated in light of the Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 amending Commission Directive (EU) 2017/845. Ireland has now established the following environmental targets, based on the revised Common Fisheries Policy, Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, which stipulates that “in order to reach the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.” </p> <p>Therefore, Ireland's environmental targets under Descriptor 3 are: <ul><li> Environmental Target D3T1: The Fishing mortality rate of populations of commercially-exploited species is at or below levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). </li> <li>Environmental Target D3T2: The Spawning Stock Biomass of populations of commercially-exploited species are above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY).</li> </ul> </p> <p>The threshold value for the proportion of stocks required to be achieving GES is 100%, following Common Fisheries Policy Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, which stipulates that <p><em>“in order to reach the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.” </em><p/> </p>"

The Celtic Seas ecoregion supports some of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. At least 8 major fishing nations currently have fisheries targeting the many marine stocks within this area. The greatest volume of landings is by Norway, UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Lesser amounts are landed by Germany, Spain and Belgium.</p> <p>These fisheries target a large number of stocks. The pelagic fisheries, which account for the largest catches (by weight) in the region are the mid-water trawl fisheries for blue whiting, mackerel, horse mackerel, herring, boarfish, and sprat. The largest demersal fishery targets hake along the shelf edge using gillnets and longlines. There are also large mixed bottom-trawl fisheries targeting benthic species, Nephrops, and gadoids. The species composition of these mixed fisheries tends to vary, depending on the area and the countries involved in the fishery. In addition, there are many inshore fisheries which take place, inside 6-12 miles and mostly use static fishing gears.</p> <p>Landings from nations such as Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark are dominated by pelagic species. Other nations within the EU target a combination of pelagic, demersal (including Nephrops), deep-water, and shellfish species. France has the highest reported effort. Effort levels for most countries show declining trends, with the most pronounced decline seen in Spanish effort.</p> <p>The catches of pelagic species vary both spatially and temporally. Mackerel and blue whiting are caught mainly on their southward migrations along the shelf edge to spawning grounds in spring. The main international blue whiting fishery is around the Porcupine Bank. Mackerel and horse mackerel are caught throughout the ecoregion and catches are highest west of Ireland. Herring catches are concentrated in the Celtic Sea, and on the Donegal coast. The highest boarfish catches are in the western Celtic Sea. The albacore tuna fishery occurs in the southwestern part of Irish waters late in the season when effort extends north from the Bay of Biscay.</p> <p>Hake are caught in deeper waters (> 70 m), along the continental shelf edge where the directed gillnet and longline fisheries occur. Anglerfish are also common throughout, with the highest catches on the shelf in the Celtic Sea. The highest megrim catches are in the western Celtic Sea. Whiting catches are highest in the Celtic Sea south of Ireland where there are also significant catches of haddock and cod. Pollack are mainly caught in inshore areas off Cornwall and along the southern coast of Ireland. The main Nephrops catches are in the western Irish Sea, the Aran Islands Ground, the Celtic Sea, and on the Porcupine Bank. Brown crab catches mainly occur off northwest Ireland.</p> <p>Otter trawl is the main gear by effort used in demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea ecoregion. The species caught depends on the area, depth-range habitat, and season fished, as well as on the cod-end mesh size, but in all cases the catches consist of a mixture of different species.</p> <p><em>Nephrops</em> is an important target species for otter trawls on discrete muddy grounds within the ecoregion. Vessels typically, although not exclusively, use twin- or quad-rig trawls with 80 mm cod-ends. A small wanted bycatch of fish species includes cod, haddock, plaice, anglerfish, and to a lesser extent sole. The use of selective gears (grids, square mesh, and separator panels) to reduce unwanted fish bycatch has increased over time. Mixed fisheries target both Nephrops and fin-fish in the Celtic Sea using a larger mesh size (100 mm or more).</p> <p>Fin-fish are targeted with both small (80-99 mm) and larger (> 99 mm) mesh sizes in different parts of the ecoregion, depending on regulation and target assemblage. Smaller mesh otter trawls and seiners are typically used to target a broad mixture of species, including gadoids, flatfish, and other benthic species. These fisheries primarily occur within the Celtic Sea, along the slope west of Ireland and Scotland, and in the western English Channel. Large-mesh otter trawlers (typically 100 mm or 120 mm) tend to target gadoids, anglerfish, or rays.</p> <p>Deep-water trawl fisheries are conducted in ICES subareas 6 and 7, principally by France, with some other participation, mainly Spanish. Trawling in waters deeper than 800 m, and gillnetting in waters deeper than 600m is prohibited by Regulation EC41/2007. This mixed deep-water trawl fishery mainly targets roundnose grenadier, black scabbardfish, and blue ling, with a bycatch mainly of smoothheads and deep-water sharks on the continental slope and offshore banks of subareas 6 and 7.</p> <p>Beam trawlers operate on sandy grounds in the Irish and Celtic seas. The majority of the vessels use meshes in the range of 80-89 mm, and come from Belgium, the UK, and Ireland. In the Irish Sea, the vessels primarily target plaice and sole (although the sole fishery has declined significantly in the last decade).</p> <p>There is also a fishery for ray species in the southern Irish Sea. In the Celtic Sea, the beam trawl fishery occurs on grounds where sole, anglerfish, cuttlefish, and megrim are abundant and the seabed is suitable for beam trawling. The fishery has bycatches of anglerfish, cod, haddock, and whiting.</p> <p>The main gillnet fishery, (mainly with 120 mm mesh size) in this ecoregion targets hake along the continental slope. Spanish, French, UK, and Irish vessels are involved in the fishery, which typically operates at depths of 150-600 m. In the shallower Celtic Sea, where mesh sizes used are 120-219 mm, target species include anglerfish, flatfish, and gadoids.</p> <p>A large number of inshore gillnetters (< 12 m) are also active in the Celtic Sea ecoregion. The target species and gears used tend to vary spatially and temporally. In the first quarter, the primary target of inshore gillnetters operating in divisions 7.g and southern 7.a is cod. Fisheries around the Irish coast seasonally target anglerfish, flatfish, pollack, and catsharks. Spanish-, French-, and UK-registered longliners target hake along the continental slope with bycatches of ling, blue ling, and other deepwater species.</p> <p>In addition to the above, inshore fishing takes place inside 12 nm of the Irish coast, while fishing from the baselines to 6nm is limited to Irish and Northern Irish owned and operated vessels only. The Irish fleet is, currently divided into a number of sub-segments. The Polyvalent [Potting] Sub-segment consists of small vessels fishing exclusively by means of pots for crustaceans and whelk. The polyvalent [Scallop] Sub-segment consists of larger vessels target great scallop. The Polyvalent [under and over 18 m length] sub-segments consist of vessels targeting a broad range of species. Some of these vessels target the same stocks as offshore fleets.</p> A new development in recent years has been the targeting of wrasse stocks, using pots, to supply cleaner fish which remove sea-lice from farmed salmon. </p> <h3>Pressures</h3> <p>The predominant pressure exerted by fishing in Irish waters has been identified as extraction of or mortality/injury to wild species by commercial fishing. This is defined as a pressure under the MSFD Commission directive 2017/845. Such extraction of fish from a stock through fishing leads to fishing mortality on target and by-catch species. Fishing mortality is measured under criterion D3C1 of the MSFD, whilst by-catch mortality is measured against D1C1 under the D1 biodiversity descriptor of the MSFD. Other pressures from commercial fishing, which have been identified in Irish waters are abrasion, incidental loss of species and litter.</p> <p>No important pressures on the fish resource which do not come from commercial fishing have been identified to date. </p> <h3>State</h3> <p>The state of fish stocks is usually determined from their reproductive capability which is determined by measuring its spawning stock biomass, denoted “SSB”. In some cases, state is determined by total biomass, if SSB cannot be ascertained. For a stock to be consistent with criterion D3C2, SSB must be above levels capable of producing MSY (maximum sustainable yield). If F is too high, SSB may not stabilise around levels that could support MSY.</p> <h3>Impact</h3> <p>Among the parameters and characteristics specified in Commission Directive 2017/845 that are likely to be impacted upon by fisheries are: changes to distribution and/or biomass; size, age and sex structure, fecundity, survival and mortality/injury; behavior including movement and migration; habitat for the species (extent, suitability); and species composition within groups of species. ICES has evaluated the main impacts of fishing on the marine environment as extraction, abrasion and smothering.</p> <p>Extraction of, or mortality/injury to, wild species by fishing and other activities impacts on food webs, benthos, populations of fish, seabirds and mammals. Such extraction of fish from a stock through fishing activities is measured as fishing mortality and is denoted “F”. Fishing mortality should be at or below rates which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) to be consistent with D3C1 of the MSFD. This rate is termed F<sub>MSY</sub>. For stocks which are either at or at risk of being unable to reproduce themselves, fishing mortality must be reduced to below F<sub>MSY</sub>, to a rate consistent with recovery. The reproductive capability of a fish stock is measured as its spawning stock biomass, denoted “SSB”. In some cases, state is determined by total biomass, if SSB cannot be ascertained. To be consistent with criterion D3C2, SSB must be above levels capable of producing MSY. If F is too high, SSB may not stabilise around levels that could support MSY.</p> <p>Physical disturbance (abrasion and smothering) of the seabed by fishing impacts on marine habitats in general, on benthos and on marine productivity. Abrasion is associated with bottom-contacting mobile and set fishing activities, in particular scallop dredging, beam trawling, and otter trawling but also other activities such as anchoring and hydrodynamic dredging. Smothering refers to activities contributing to change in siltation on the seabed include dredging for shipping, disposal of materials to the seafloor, and commercial fishing.</p> <p>ICES has previously advised zero catches in this ecoregion for stocks of rare or threatened species such as basking shark, porbeagle, angel shark, the common skate complex, white skates, undulate rays, orange roughy, deep-water sharks (kitefin shark, leafscale gulper shark, Portuguese dogfish), and greater silver smelt. These stocks have been either targeted or by-caught in fisheries in the past and are now depleted. Information on these stocks is sparse, but they require special management attention to conserve remaining populations. </p> <h3>Assessment Method</h3> <p>The assessment is based on results of ICES or Marine Institute advice/additional assessments for individual stocks, giving results in terms of F (D3C1) and SSB (D3C2). All stocks which have a landings value recorded in the FAO FISHSTAT database were included, if the stock occurs the Irish MSFD area. In a few cases additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the status of stocks which have not previously been advised upon by either the MI or ICES. However, no additional assessments were performed for any stock which was already assessed by ICES, even if ICES classified the stock as unknown.</p> <p>ICES provides advice on fishing mortality and SSB reference points F<sub>MSY</sub> and MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. F<sub>MSY</sub> is estimated as the fishing mortality with a given fishing pattern and current environmental conditions that gives the long-term maximum yield. MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> is the lower bound of spawning-stock biomass fluctuation when fished at F<sub>MSY</sub>. The approach does not use a B<sub>MSY</sub> estimate. B<sub>MSY</sub> is a notional value around which stock size fluctuates when fishing at F<sub>MSY</sub>. Determination of MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> requires contemporary data with fishing at F<sub>MSY</sub> to identify the normal range of fluctuations in biomass when stocks are fished at this fishing mortality rate. When sufficient observations of SSB fluctuations associated with fishing around F<sub>MSY</sub> are available, the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> should be re-estimated to correspond to the lower bound of the range of stock sizes associated with MSY.</p> <p>For all shellfish stocks other than <em>Nephrops</em> stocks the Marine Institute analyses were used to populate this assessment. These analyses are presented in the Review of Shellfish Stocks 2018. Two methods are used to establish F in relation to F<sub>MSY</sub>, spawning potential ratio (SPR) or harvest ratio (HR). SPR defines the ratio of spawning under current (likely) fishing mortality rate to that of an unexploited stock (Bo). Limit and target reference points for SPR are generally accepted to be 0.1 and 0.35 respectively based on meta-analysis of fish stocks response to exploitation. Hence 0.35*SPRBo corresponds to B<sub>MSY</sub>. Where the SPR is not defined analytically it can be described by the relationship between size at maturity and size at first capture (Minimum Landing Size or Minimum Conservation Reference Size, MCRS) especially where discard mortality is negligible as is the case for most shellfish. All shellfish have an MCRS which is designed to enable some spawning escapement and which provides for a given SPR. HR or catch biomass ratio, is the proportion of the biomass, removed annually. HR corresponding to F<sub>MSY</sub> will vary between stocks i.e. some species can sustain higher levels of F or HR than others. For stocks where reference points are unavailable the sustainable HR is unknown. In these cases, the response of the stock to the HRs, and which are controlled by TAC, are monitored over time and adapted.</p> <p>For non-ICES shellfish stocks, stock biomass can be described directly from surveys, where such surveys provide estimates of absolute biomass, and by proxies such as biomass indicators from surveys or catch per unit effort (CPUE) from commercial data. The stock status relative to B<sub>MSY</sub> is not generally known but proxies could include trends in surveys or CPUE and comparison of current or recent position against long term trends. This should, however, be qualified given that the historic trend is likely to already represent an exploited stock time series and true Bo (unexploited) or B<sub>MSY</sub> remains unknown. These time series can also be analysed using various stock assessment procedures and may provide estimates of B<sub>MSY</sub>.</p> <p>For a small number of stocks not assessed by either ICES or the MI through its shellfish assessments, survey trend analyses were performed. The reference point used in these analyses was the relationship between survey abundance over time versus the long term average, following Commission Decision 2017/848 concerning the determination of GES. Those stocks above the average were considered to be have achieved GES.</p> <p>The assessment was carried out for 177 stocks/species of fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Of the stocks in Irish waters, 18% were found to have achieved GES while the environmental status of 59% of stocks is unknown. A further 22% of stocks were found not to have achieved GES.</p> <p>ICES advises that the data currently collected on fish length for stock assessment purposes is suitable to assess the size distribution of a stock (D3C3) but that until the proof of concept has been validated, D3C3 is not operational for MSFD assessment purposes. </p> <h3>Assessment Result</h3> <p>The assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES) of commercial fish stocks is based on whether stocks are fished at or below a rate consistent with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and whether their SSB is above the level that can produce MSY.</p> <p>For pelagic fish, 3 stocks were found to have achieved GES, 5 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 6 stocks is currently unknown. Among the pelagic stocks that have achieved GES are albacore tuna, swordfish and Irish Sea herring. Among the stocks not achieving GES are mackerel, blue whiting and western horse mackerel. Horse mackerel met criterion D3C1 (F&#8804F<sub>MSY</sub>) but not D3C2 (SSB > MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>). In contrast, mackerel and blue whiting met criterion D3C2 but not D3C1. Some stocks not meeting criterion D3C2 were experiencing recruitment impairment (e.g. herring in ICES Sub-area 6a and herring in the Celtic Sea). Bluefin tuna met D3C1 but was unknown in relation to D3C2 and hence unknown in relation to the achievement of GES. Others stocks were unknown under either criterion; these include sprat, pilchard and boarfish.</p> <p>For demersal fish, 10 stocks were found to have achieved GES, 18 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 18 stocks is currently unknown. Among those stocks that have achieved GES are northern hake, saithe in ICES Sub-areas 4, 6 and 3a and megrim in ICES Sub-areas 4 and 6a. Of the stocks not achieving GES, whiting in the Irish Sea, cod and sole in the Celtic Sea and plaice off southwest Ireland did not meet either assessment criterion. Stocks not meeting criterion D3C1 included haddock off NW Ireland, megrim in the Celtic Sea and Biscay, whiting and haddock in the Celtic Sea. Stocks not meeting criterion D3C2 included sea bass in ICES Sub-area 4bc, 7a, and 7d-h, cod and sole in the Irish Sea. Among the stocks of unknown environmental status were plaice, sea bass and sole off the northwest of Ireland. Anglerfish in the Celtic Sea and Biscay met criterion D3C1, but was unknown in relation to D3C2.</p> <p>Of demersal shellfish stocks, 10 were found to have achieved GES, 4 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 8 stocks is currently unknown. GES was achieved for most <em>Nephrops</em> stocks with the exception of the Aran grounds stock, whilst the environmental status of Nephrops on the Porcupine grounds is currently unknown overall but it did not meet D3C1. Edible crab stocks met criterion D3C1, but were unknown for D3C2. Most king scallop stocks were found have achieved GES overall. </p> <p>For coastal shellfish stocks, 9 stocks were found to have achieved GES, 15 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 23 stocks is currently unknown. Most razor clam stocks have achieved GES, though most lobster and native oyster stocks have not done so. Many lobster stocks met criterion D3C2 but not D3C1. In contrast most native oyster stocks met D3C1 but not D3C2.</p> <p>Of the elasmobranch stocks being commercially exploited, the environmental status of most stocks (n&#8805 16) was found to be currently unknown. One stock (i.e. blue shark) was found to have achieved GES, while shortfin mako shark and spurdog have not achieved GES. Spurdog met criterion D3C1, unlike the others.</p> <p>Among the remaining commercially-exploited stocks in Irish waters, the environmental status of all cephalopod stocks and coastal fish is found to be currently unknown. This will require more work, particularly for the coastal fish species. This work would involve biological studies and catch data collection schemes. </p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>GES has been achieved for many but not for all commercially exploited fish and shellfish stocks in Ireland's waters. The environmental status of many assessed stocks (n&#8805 99) is currently unknown. This is the case for stocks assessed by ICES and those assessed nationally. An estimated 25% of commercial stocks have not achieved GES.</p> <p>There was a substantial improvement in the metric for commercial fisheries Criterion D3C1, fishing mortality. Of the stocks assessed in both MSFD cycles so far, there was an 80% improvement in stocks meeting the requirements under Criterion D3C1. Though the proportion of all assessed stocks achieving GES is unchanged from 2013 there was a 25% improvement in the number of stocks that were originally found not to have achieved GES in 2013.</p> <p>A direct comparison with the initial assessment in 2013 (i.e. the same 52 stocks) shows a 70% improvement in the number of stocks that have achieved GES, with an almost 70% reduction in the number of such stocks for which the environmental status is unknown. Nevertheless, almost 60% more stocks were found not to have achieved GES. </p> <h3>Knowledge Gaps</h3> <p>It is not currently possible to determine whether some stocks are within safe biological limits because information is inadequate to assess both pressure and state. In the case of some stocks or species, it may never be possible to assess their environmental status in relation to GES. This is particularly challenging for cephalopod stocks, which are not easily assessed because they are so short-lived and are subject to fluctuations driven by environmental changes. Further work is also required to assess the status of some coastal fish (e.g. wrasse), which are currently unassessed.</p> <p>Apart from coastal stocks, almost all stocks in this assessment are exploited by more than one country. In order to assess progress towards achievement or maintenance of GES for these shared stocks, the assessments need to be undertaken in an international forum such as ICES. For the coastal stocks, work is ongoing at a national level on determining their life history parameters, quantification of catch and assessment of sustainable exploitation rates.</p> <p>More work and international cooperation is required to analyse if age and size distribution metrics available for populations of commercially exploited species are indicative of healthy populations (i.e. Criterion D3C3).</p> <h3>Data Sources</h3> <p>Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. 2018.

"9","Mixed Fisheries","","<h3> FEAS Advice for 2018 </h3> <p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice as a tool for management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea. However, the current modelling procedure used to produce this advice is under development. The methodology and underlying assumptions need to be investigated further. Therefore mixed fisheries catch option scenarios provided by ICES, can only be viewed as preliminary and should not be used to set the TACs for cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea.</p><hr/> <h3> Background </h3> <p>Fisheries in the Celtic Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a variety of different gears. Therefore, in line with the operational nature of the fishery, ICES now produces mixed-fisheries scenarios for the Celtic Sea. This advice sheet highlights the potential implications of single stock management on the catches of multiple stocks caught together in mixed-fisheries. The species considered within this advice are cod (27.7.e-k), haddock (27.7.b-k) and whiting (27.7.b-c & e-k).</p> <p>Past fishing patterns, catchability of fleets and single species TAC advice are used to produce a quantitative forecast of over- and under- exploitation of the different stocks given their mixed fishery interactions. Forecasts are summarised in a range of potential management scenarios.</p> <p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts produced for 2018 indicate that the most limiting stocks (i.e. the stock where the first quota is reached for most fleets) in the Celtic Sea gadoid mixed fisheries will be haddock. Under the scenarios presented for 2018 a significant change to the exploitation pattern for haddock would be required to avoid overexploitation.</p> <h3> Summary of Scenarios </h3> <p>Eight mixed-fisheries forecast scenarios were produced for the Celtic Sea, all of which are defined and detailed within the ICES advice sheet. Scenarios that result in under- or overutilization of stock are useful in identifying imbalance between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks. They indicate in which direction fleets may have to adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. Here follows a brief summary of the outcomes of these scenarios for 2018 and their associated landings (Table 1): <li> The ''minimum'' scenario indicates that haddock is the most limiting stock (representing 64% of effort in 2016). This scenario assumes that the discard ban is strictly implemented for each fleet and fishing stops when the catch of a fleet reaches its quota share of any of the three stocks. <li> The ''maximum'' scenario gives very similar results to the ''whiting'' scenario, indicating that whiting is the least limiting quota. The maximum scenario assumes that there is no limit on discarding and each fleet continues fishing until they exhaust their quota share of all the stocks. <li> Only the ''minimum'' and ''haddock'' scenarios meet the objective of all stocks being fished at or below F<sub>MSY</sub>. The haddock scenario assumes that fishing stops when a fleet reaches its quota share of haddock. This implies reducing effort levels by 42% compared to those observed in 2016. <li> The ''range'' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future. It utilises the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery. That option results in an F for haddock close to the upper limit of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range. The F for cod slightly below F<sub>MSY</sub> and the F for whiting well below F<sub>MSY</sub> and close to the lower bound of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range. The resulting biomass projections in 2019 are above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> for all three stocks and are therefore can be considered safe harvesting practices in the short term.</p> <p>WGMIXFISH produces advice based on catch per mixed-fisheries scenarios in 2018. In total there are 8 scenarios, maximum, minimum, COD, HAD, WHG, status quo effort, value and range. All scenarios are described in detail in the attached advice sheet. Here FEAS has convert that catch advice given in Table 2 into approximate landings (tonnes) estimates for each stock and each scenario in the table below. The official ICES landings for 2016 and the single species advice for 2018 have been included for comparative purposes.</p>","<h3>FEAS Advice for 2019</h3> <p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice as a tool for management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea.

They indicate in which direction fleets may have to adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. Here follows a brief summary of the outcomes of these scenarios for 2019: <li>The results show that in 2019 it is not possible to achieve all management objectives simultaneously, as no catch of haddock or whiting is consistent with the cod single species advice of zero catch. The 'minimum' scenario confirms that this mismatch is due to the fact that all fleets operating within the Celtic Sea catch cod to some extent, resulting in cod being a ""choke"" species for haddock and whiting. Therefore, the 'minimum' scenario results in zero catch of all three gadoids. <li>This year an additional scenario of cod catches under the MSY approach ('cod_F<sub>MSY</sub>') is presented. The low value of F (0.12) under the cod MSY approach (assuming a non-zero catch) results in substantial undershoots of both haddock and whiting, as fishing is stopped when the cod quota is reached. <li>The 'maximum' scenario gives very similar results to the 'whiting' scenario, indicating that whiting is the least limiting quota. The maximum scenario assumes that there is no limit on discarding and each fleet continues fishing until they exhaust their quota share of all the stocks. <li>The 'range' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future. It utilises the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery. The outcomes of this scenario are driven by the restrictive nature of the cod advice this year, with the minimum of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range advice for haddock and whiting resulting from the need to reduce cod catches to a minimum.</p>","<h3>FEAS Advice for 2020</h3> <p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice to inform the management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea. In 2019 the mixed fisheries advice will be incorporated into the ICES fisheries overviews which are to be published in late November. This change is hoped to provide context to the complex technical interactions within the area.</p> <p>In addition, the EC has asked to estimate the likely by-catches of Celtic sea cod and plaice, Irish sea whiting and west of Scotland cod and whiting under various catch scenarios for the target species. Details of this ICES technical service is provided below.</p><hr/> <h3>Background</h3> <p>Fisheries in the Celtic Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a variety of different gears.

Forecasts are summarised in a range of potential management scenarios. </p> <h3>Summary of Scenarios</h3> <p>Traditionally, the mixed fisheries advice has comprised Celtic Sea cod (27.7.e-k), haddock (27.7.b-k) and whiting (27.7.b-c & e-k) in eight mixed-fisheries forecast scenarios. These scenarios are defined by the species and TAC incorporated into the model, determining under- or over-utilization of stock, which is useful in identifying imbalance amongst the fishing opportunities of the stocks. They indicate the direction in which fleets may best adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities, without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. The 'range' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future. It utilises the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery. For 2020 outcomes are driven by the restrictive nature of the cod advice, with the minimum of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range advice for haddock and whiting resulting from the need to reduce catches of cod to a minimum.</p> <p>This year the ICES Working Group on Mixed Fisheries Advice continued to explore and test the possibility of expanding the number of species included in the Celtic Sea mixed fisheries analysis. A mixed fishery model for the Irish sea is being developed, and it is hoped to provide mixed fishery catch options for the Irish sea in the future. Priority for inclusion is being given to target species of economic importance for which category 1 assessments are available. The principle challenges faced when incorporating new species are aligning the single species assessments with multi-area and multispecies TACs. This is further complicated by varying assumptions of species mixing within individual stocks.</p> <h3>Future Direction </h3> <p>A scoping meeting will be held with advice recipients and stakeholders at ICES HQ in early March 2020 to discuss the next generation and future of WGMIXFISH advice. This meeting aims to review recent scientific developments, modelling and visualization, to create awareness of what is currently achievable, and identify potential approaches, content and presentation of this advice in the future. </p> <h3>ICES Technical Service on Bycatch Stocks</h3><p>The EU requested ICES to provide likely catches in 2020 of bycatch/non-targeted stocks that have zero catch advice (cod in divisions 7.e-k and 6.a and in Subdivision 21, whiting in divisions 6.a and 7.a, and plaice in divisions 7.h and 7.j-k).</p> <p>The commission wanted to know what the bycatch of these stocks would be under scenarios of the MSY range from the WWMAP, and assuming that selective gear was adopted by the fleets. The analyses conducted by ICES highlights some shortcomings where the tool used cannot be easily applied when the assessments are qualitative. It is not possible to accurately predict the impact of a change in fisher behaviour in adopting more selective gear, because data on this was not available. Notwithstanding these shortcomings the analyses for Celtic sea cod and plaice, Irish sea whiting and west of Scotland cod and whiting, gives the likely bycatches of these stocks under catch scenarios for the target species.</p> <p>Full details of this technical service can be found here: <a href&#8805 ""https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2019/Special_Requests/eu.2019.23.pdf"" target&#8805 ""_blank"">ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2019/Special_Requests/eu.2019.23.pdf</a></p>",""
