Summary,"<p> In 2016 ICES produced ecosystem overviews for four European ecoregions. These overviews provide a description of the ecosystems, identify the main human pressures, and explain how these pressures affect key ecosystem components. The Celtic Seas ecoregion overview, which covers the whole Irish EEZ including the West of Scotland, the Malin Shelf, the Irish Sea, and the Celtic Sea, is included in this section.  </p>  
<p> The five most important pressures in the Celtic Seas ecoregion are selective extraction of species, abrasion, smothering, substrate loss, and nutrient and organic enrichment. These pressures are linked mainly to the following human activities: fishing, aquaculture, coastal construction, land-based industry, maritime transport, agriculture, dredging, and offshore structures for renewable and non-renewable energy sources. </p>
<p> Figures more specific to Irish fisheries are included before the ICES overview. In general, relative fishing pressure has declined in the last ten years while relative spawning stock biomass has remained stable. 
In 2015/2016:
<li>  35% of stocks were fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>  (53% unknown) </li>
<li>  30% of stocks have SSB above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>   (54% unknown) </li>
<li>  20% of landings came from stocks fished above F<sub>MSY</sub> </li>
<li>  96% of landings came from stocks having SSB above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> </li> </p>
","<p> In 2016 ICES produced ecosystem overviews for four European ecoregions. Two more ecoregions were added in 2017 and the first four are due to be reviewed in 2018. These overviews provide a description of the ecosystems, identify the main human pressures, and explain how these pressures affect key ecosystem components. The interactive version of the Celtic Seas ecoregion overview, which covers the whole Irish EEZ including the West of Scotland, the Malin Shelf, the Irish Sea, and the Celtic Sea, is available at: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2y9mup3""  target=""_blank"">Click Here</a>. </p>

These pressures are linked mainly to the following human activities: fishing, aquaculture, coastal construction, land-based industry, maritime transport, agriculture, dredging, and offshore structures for renewable and non-renewable energy sources. </p>
<p> In the near future ICES will publish a fisheries overview for the Celtic Seas ecoregion. This overview will summarise the state of all of the assessed fish and shellfish stocks and the fishing pressures being applied to them. It will do so in more detail than the ecosystem overview. The framework for the advice will be structured as: ecosystem overview -> fisheries overview -> single stock advice. Information and plots similar to the as-yet-unpublished ICES fisheries overviews are included in the current and MSFD D3 sections of the Stock Book 2017. </p>

Considerations,"FEAS advises that the following considerations should be taken into account when developing ecosystem based management objectives: 
<li>  Fishing has impacted a number of commercial species, with some commercial species such as cod and whiting in the Irish Sea now being considered collapsed. A cod long term management plan is currently in place. </li>
<li>  Demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, West of Scotland and Rockall are mixed fisheries, catching a large number of commercial and non-commercial species.  Many of the species caught are discarded. Mixed fisheries do not only affect the commercial stocks that are presented in this Stock Book, but impact on the wider fish community. </li>
<li>  The ICES mixed fisheries advice for the Celtic Sea (7.b-c and 7.e-k) is included at the end of this section. However, ICES does not recommend specific mixed-fisheries catch opportunities as no mixed-fisheries management objectives are available. </li>
<li>  Discarding rates are also high on many commercial species in these areas.  Recently introduced technical measures such as increased cod-end mesh size and square mesh panels in the Celtic Sea need to be monitored in order to evaluate their effectiveness. Certain demersal quota species are now subject to the demersal landing obligation. </li>
<li>  Demersal trawling impacts on benthic habitats and their communities. The resilience and recoverability of habitats varies depending on substrate type, biota and type of fishing gear. The overall impact of demersal trawling on the seabed needs to be evaluated in relation to the proportion of different habitats impacted (see Fig. 5.1.4 in ICES Ecosystem Overview). </li>
<li>  A number of rare endangered and/or vulnerable species of cetaceans, seals, seabirds and elasmobranchs are resident or transient in Irish waters. The management of fisheries needs to ensure that the conservation of these species is not compromised.</li>
<li>  Pelagic fish species such as herring, blue whiting, mackerel and horse mackerel are keystone food web species and changes in their abundance can have significant consequences up the marine food chain.  </li>
<li>  Due to their low reproductive output and longevity, many deep-water fish species are very vulnerable to overfishing. High levels of exploitation have led to the depletion of many deep-water fish stocks in ICES subareas 6 and 7. </li>
<li>  NEAFC and the EU have already closed a number of areas on the Rockall Bank, the Hatton Bank, the Porcupine Bank and the western European Slope to bottom impacting fishing gear, where cold water corals are known to occur.  The UK is also in the process of establishing MPAs in a number of deep-water sites such as Rosemary Bank Seamount, Anton Dohrn, and The Canyons. Furthermore, the proposed EU deep-sea trawling ban, which could begin as early as January 2017, will restrict fishing below 800m with mobile bottom contacting gears. </li>
<li>  Deepwater species are dependent on nutrient input from the upper ocean layers via planktonic snow, mesopelagic species and fall of carcasses. This should be taken into account when considering the development of commercial fisheries for mesopelagic species. </li>
<li>  In order to implement the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAFM), fisheries management should incentivise fishing behaviour and introduce management tools that reduce the impact of fishing on the wider ecosystem. </li>

<li> Overall fishing pressure on the commercial fish and shellfish stocks in the Celtic Seas ecoregion has decreased since its peak in 1998 and the average F to F<sub>MSY</sub> ratios for the combined demersal, flatfish, and pelagic stocks is now close to F<sub>MSY</sub>. </li>
<li> Overall biomass of commercial fish and shellfish stocks in the Celtic Sea has increased and the average SSB to B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> ratio for the combined demersal, shellfish, and pelagic stocks in the Celtic Seas ecosystem is now above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>.</li>
<li> The fishing effort of bottom mobile gears in the Celtic Seas ecoregion decreased by 35% from 2003 to 2014. This has reduced the spatial fishing footprint and the average number of times the seabed is trawled per year.</li>
<li> Temperature affects the migration, distribution, and onset of spawning of blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou, Northeast Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus, western horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus, and boarfish Capros aper.</li>
<li> Sea temperature affects the recruitment of some gadoids in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and west of Scotland. The Celtic Seas ecoregion is at the edge of the geographical range of several species, potentially making these species more susceptible to environmental variation.</li>

PressureState,"<p> Relative fishing pressure (F/F<sub>MSY</sub>) and biomass (SSB/B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>) are shown for each of four Irish ecoregions (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, West of Scotland, and Widely Distributed). Each plot on the top left shows SSB and F related against reference points (MSY where available, otherwise PA or qualitative). Stocks in the green region are exploited below F<sub>MSY</sub> and have an SSB that is above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>. Stocks of unknown status are depicted in the top right plot. In both plots the size of each bubble corresponds to the landings of each stock in 2015. FU refers to <em>Nephrops</em> functional units. </p>
<p> The pie charts depict the proportion of the total 2015 landings in each region fished at or below F<sub>MSY</sub> (green), above F<sub>MSY</sub> (red) and of unknown status (grey) in relation to fishing mortality reference points (bottom left) and with biomass above B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (green), below B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (red) and of unknown status in relation to biomass reference points (bottom right). </p>
","<p> To assess progress towards GES the average ratio of F/F<sub>MSY</sub> and B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is plotted for demersal, pelagic and <em>Nephrops</em> stock seperately below (Figure 4).  These plots show that pelagic stocks have on average been fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> since the mid 2000s.  The <em>Nephrops</em> stocks have fluctuated around F<sub>MSY</sub> throughout the time series.  The largest change can be seen in demersal stocks where on average F was three times F<sub>MSY</sub> up to the mid 2000s and there has been a declining trend towards F<sub>MSY</sub> since then.  Average biomass for <em>Nephrops</em> and pelagic stocks has fluctuated above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> throught the time series.  The average biomass of demersal stocks shows an increasing trend since the mid 2000s and is now above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>.</p>
<p>The ratio of F in 2016 to F<sub>MSY</sub> and biomass in 2016 to MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> for all the stocks with D3C1 and D3C2 assessments are plotted below (Figure 5).  The stock codes used by ICES are  shown to identify the individual stocks.   The stocks with green points are those with GES in 2017.  The stocks with red dots do not have GES. This plot shows that cod in the west of Scotland (cod.27.6a) is in the worst condition of all stocks with a very low biomass (close to zero) and an F that is several times F<sub>MSY</sub>.  Others stock in very poor condition include whiting in the Irish Sea (whg,27.7a) and plaice in 7.h-k (ple.27.7h-k).  The majority of other stocks without GES are either close to the targets or with biomasses above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>.  There are also a number of depleted stocks which now have low fishing mortality but their biomasses are yet to recover.  These are in the bottom left quadrant and include Irish Sea sole (sol.27.7a), herring west of Scotland (her.276a7bc) and whiting west of Scotland (whg-scow).</p>
<p>The bar plot (Figure 6) shows the catches or landings by stock sorted from highest volume to lowest volume.  The colour of the bar indicates whether the stock has GES status (green = yes, red = no, grey = unknown). Circles indicate landings, whereas triangles are catches. The two very high volume stocks, blue whiting (whb-comb) and mackerel (mac-nea), were both overfished in 2016.  These stocks account for a large proportion of the landed biomass in 2016.

D3Ass,,"<h3> MSFD PRELIMINARY GES RESULTS FOR D3 IN 2017 </h3> 
<p> For all stocks exploited by the Irish fleet of OSPAR Region III, 
<li>  Overall, 46% of stocks where an assessment is carried out achieve GES. These stocks account for  198,278t of biomass </li>
<li>  67% of stocks with primary indicators were fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> - (44% of stocks are at unknown fishing mortality status). 11% of landings came from stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>.</li>
<li>  69% of stocks with primary indicators have SSB above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> (51% of stocks are at unknown biomass status). 79% of landings came from stocks having SSB above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub>. </li>
Great care is needed in the interpretation of these figures.  Only 11% of landings came from stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>. This can be partly explained by the landings of mackerel and blue whiting which are fished above F<sub>MSY</sub>. </p>

<h3> TRENDS  </h3> 
<p> It is important to note that the D3C1 and D3C2 analysis results presented above represent a snapshot.  It is possible to look at progress towards GES targets over time for groups of assessed stocks.  This analysis shows that on average:
<li>  Pelagic stocks have been fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> since the mid-2000s,</li>
<li>  Harvesting of <em>Nephrops</em> stocks has been around F<sub>MSY</sub> and below since 2013.</li>
<li>  Fishing mortality for demersal stocks shows a strongly declining trend since the mid-2000s although it remains above F<sub>MSY</sub>.</li>
<li>  Biomasses of demersal, pelagic and <em>Nephrops</em> stocks are all above MSY B<sub>TRIGGER</sub> since 2010.  The average biomass for demersal stocks shows a strongly increasing trend since the late 2000s.</li>

<p> The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) of the EUs marine waters by 2020 and to protect the resource base upon which marine-related economic and social activities depend.  It is the first EU legislative instrument related to the protection of marine biodiversity, as it contains the explicit regulatory objective that ''biodiversity is maintained by 2020'', as the cornerstone for achieving GES.  The Directive enshrines in a legislative framework the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities having an impact on the marine environment, integrating the concepts of environmental protection and sustainable use.  In order to achieve its goal, the Directive establishes European marine regions and sub-regions on the basis of geographical and environmental criteria. The Directive lists four European marine regions - the Baltic Sea, the North-east Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.  The sea area around Ireland comprises OSPAR Region III - the Celtic Seas and Irelands MSFD work relates to this area (OSPAR = Oslo Paris Conventions - a mechanism by which the EU and 17 member states co-operate to protect the north east Atlantic ecosystem).  </p>

<p> In order to implement the MSFD, each Member State is required to: 
<li>  Describe what they consider is a clean healthy and productive sea (i.e. GES);</li>
<li>  Monitor and assess the quality of their seas against GES; </li>
<li>  Ensure appropriate action is taken by 2020 to maintain and achieve GES.  </li>

","<h3>MSFD PRELIMINARY GES RESULTS FOR D3 IN 2018 </h3>
<p>For all stocks exploited by the Irish fleet of OSPAR Region III, 
<li> Overall, 49% of stocks where an assessment is carried out achieve GES. These stocks account for about 350,000 t of catch.
<li> 69% of stocks with primary indicators were fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> - (40% of stocks are at unknown fishing mortality status). 15% of catch came from stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>.
<li> 65% of stocks with primary indicators have SSB above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (79% of stocks are at unknown biomass status). 93% of catch came from stocks having SSB above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. </p>

<p>The two stocks with largest outtakes (mackerel and blue whiting) are both fished above F<sub>MSY</sub>, and this accounts for the low proportion of catch that is represented by GES.</p>

<h3>Marine Stratgey Framework Directive MSFD</h3>
<p>The Marine Directive aims to achieve Good Environmental Status of the EU's marine waters by 2020 and to protect the resource base upon which marine-related economic and social activities depend. Seas in Good Environmental Status are clean, healthy and productive. The Directive enshrines in a legislative framework the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities having an impact on the marine environment, integrating the concepts of environmental protection and sustainable use. 
According to the Directive, each Member State must implement a marine strategy for its marine waters, in cooperation with other Member States sharing the same marine region, reviewed every 6 years. Those strategies include 5 steps:
<ol><li>an initial assessment of their marine waters,
<li>the determination of the good environmental status of their marine waters,
<li>the setting of environmental targets,
<li>the establishment and implementation of coordinated monitoring programmes, and
<li>the identification of measures or actions that need to be taken in order to achieve or maintain good environmental status.</ol></p>
 
<p>In 2012, for the first time, Member States reported on the state of the environment in their marine waters, on what they consider as being a ""good environmental status"" and on the objectives and targets they have set themselves to reach it by 2020. The result showed that more efforts were urgently needed if the EU was to reach its 2020 goal.  The Commission assessed those first elements against the Directive's requirements.  <p>

<p>On 16 January 2017, the Commission adopted a report assessing monitoring programmes submitted by most Member States in 2014 and 2015 to verify compliance with the Directive.</p>

<p>By March 2016, Member States had to set up and implement programmes of measures to achieve good environmental status in their marine waters and to address each of the MSFD descriptors. The individual measures should as a whole aim to ensure that environmental targets are addressed and good environmental status (GES) is achieved or maintained by 2020.</p>

<p>On 31 July 2018, the Commission adopted its report assessing these programmes, identifying whether they constitute an appropriate framework within the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and whether they address the pressures that the EU seas and oceans are facing.</p>

<p>The Commission concluded that while considerable efforts have been made by Member States, not all pressures are covered properly by the measures. The Commission therefore provided recommendations to Member States to guide them in accordance with Article 16 of the Directive.</p>

<p>European Commission DGENV has taken note of progress towards rolling out Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the EU has committed to ensure the conservation of 10% of its coastal and marine areas by 2020. In 2012, 5.9 % of Europe's seas had already been designated as marine protected areas, and work is continuing with a view to achieve 10 % coverage by 2020. This objective is also reflected in Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Commission aims to work with Member States to designate, manage and control marine protected areas through financing mechanisms such as the LIFE Programme and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, while promoting inclusive governance structures for and research on marine protected areas.</p>

<h3>MSFD Descriptor D3 (Commerical Fish and Shellfish)</h3>
<p>ICES conducts stock assessments giving results for D3C1 and D3C2 and has recently developed MSY proxies for some data limited stocks (those without full analytic assessments). ICES advises that the GES assessment for the MSFD D3 should be based on criteria D3C1 (Fishing Mortality) and D3C2 (Spawning Stock Biomass). The assessment should be based only on those stocks that have primary indicators (MSY reference points). </p>
<p>ICES advises that the aggregation of the assessment results of criteria D3C1 and D3C2 by stock should be done such that only if both criteria are met will GES be achieved for that stock. This is sometimes referred to as the ""one out all out"" method.</p>
<p>ICES advises that the data currently collected on fish length for stock assessment purposes is suitable to assess the size distribution of a stock (D3C3) but that until the proof of concept has been validated, D3C3 be considered as a surveillance indicator for size distribution.</p>","<p>The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires that Good Environmental Status (GES) is achieved for commercial fish and shellfish by 2020.

<p>ICES and the MI have conducted stock assessments giving results for D3C1 and D3C2 and have recently developed MSY proxies for some data limited stocks (those without full analytic assessments). ICES advises that the GES assessment for the MSFD D3 should be based on criteria D3C1 (Fishing Mortality) and D3C2 (Spawning Stock Biomass) i.e. Category 1 and 2 advice types.

<p>The Marine Directive aims to achieve Good Environmental Status of the EU's marine waters by 2020 and to protect the resource base upon which marine-related economic and social activities depend. Seas in Good Environmental Status are clean, healthy and productive. The Directive enshrines in a legislative framework the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities having an impact on the marine environment, integrating the concepts of environmental protection and sustainable use. 
According to the Directive, each Member State must implement a marine strategy for its marine waters, in cooperation with other Member States sharing the same marine region, reviewed every 6 years. Those strategies include 5 steps:
<ol><li>an initial assessment of their marine waters,
<li>the determination of the good environmental status of their marine waters,
<li>the setting of environmental targets,
<li>the establishment and implementation of coordinated monitoring programmes, and
<li>the identification of measures or actions that need to be taken in order to achieve or maintain good environmental status.</li></ol></p>
 
<p>In 2012, for the first time, Member States reported on the state of the environment in their marine waters, on what they consider as being a ""good environmental status"" and on the objectives and targets they have set themselves to reach it by 2020. The result showed that more efforts were urgently needed if the EU was to reach its 2020 goal.  The Commission assessed those first elements against the Directive's requirements.  </p>

<p>On 16 January 2017, the Commission adopted a report assessing monitoring programmes submitted by most Member States in 2014 and 2015 to verify compliance with the Directive.</p>

<p>By March 2016, Member States had to set up and implement programmes of measures to achieve good environmental status in their marine waters and to address each of the MSFD descriptors. The individual measures should as a whole aim to ensure that environmental targets are addressed and good environmental status (GES) is achieved or maintained by 2020.</p>

<p>On 31 July 2018, the Commission adopted its report assessing these programmes, identifying whether they constitute an appropriate framework within the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and whether they address the pressures that the EU seas and oceans are facing. The Commission concluded that while considerable efforts have been made by Member States, not all pressures are covered properly by the measures. The Commission therefore provided recommendations to Member States to guide them in accordance with Article 16 of the Directive.</p>

<p>European Commission DGENV has taken note of progress towards rolling out Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the EU has committed to ensure the conservation of 10% of its coastal and marine areas by 2020. In 2012, 5.9 % of Europe's seas had already been designated as marine protected areas, and work is continuing with a view to achieve 10 % coverage by 2020. This objective is also reflected in Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Commission aims to work with Member States to designate, manage and control marine protected areas through financing mechanisms such as the LIFE Programme and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, while promoting inclusive governance structures for and research on marine protected areas.</p>

<h3>MSFD Descriptor D3 (Commerical Fish and Shellfish)</h3>
<p>ICES and the MI have conducted stock assessments giving results for D3C1 and D3C2 and have recently developed MSY proxies for some data limited stocks (those without full analytic assessments). ICES advises that the GES assessment for the MSFD D3 should be based on criteria D3C1 (Fishing Mortality) and D3C2 (Spawning Stock Biomass) i.e. Category 1 and 2 advice types. However, the Commission Decision 848/2017 gives further guidance on how to handle stocks for which ICES advice is unavailable, and this guidance was followed in the following assessment.</p>
<p>ICES advises that the aggregation of the assessment results of criteria D3C1 and D3C2 by stock should be done such that only if both criteria are met will GES be achieved for that stock. This is sometimes referred to as the ""one out all out"" method.</p>
<p>ICES advises that the data currently collected on fish length for stock assessment purposes is suitable to assess the size distribution of a stock (D3C3) but that until the proof of concept has been validated, D3C3 be considered as a surveillance indicator for size distribution.</p>  <h3>Second Irish D3 Assessment Of Criteria Elements D3C1, D3C2 AND D3C3 Extraction Of, Or Mortality/Injury To, Wild Species Including Target And Non-Target Species, As Presented To The European Commission In 2020</h3><p>An updated assessment has now been carried out with respect to the original Marine Strategy Framework Directive and newly established criteria, elements and methodological standards as set out in Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 and amending Commission Directive (EU) 2017/845. </p>

A key finding is that there has been a substantial improvement in fishing mortality, assessed under Criterion D3C1 set out in Commission Decision 2017/848. Of the commercially exploited stocks that were assessed in both cycles, there was an 80% improvement in the fishing mortality criterion. It is concluded that a total of 34 stocks have achieved GES, while the environmental status of 99 stocks is currently unknown. In the case of 44 other stocks, GES is not being achieved.</p>                                                                            <h3>Background</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <p>Fisheries that occur in Ireland's maritime area are managed both under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and nationally for stocks not subject to the EU quota regime. This assessment covers all criteria elements under MSFD D3. The assessment covers both stocks managed under the CFP and those managed nationally, which are fished in Irish MSFD waters. Many of these stocks straddle the boundary between Ireland and other jurisdictions, while some are exploited in Irish waters, but not by Irish vessels. The relevant criteria for inclusion of stocks in the assessment are based on Commission Decision 848/2017, as follows:
<ol type=""a""><li> all stocks that are managed under Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;
<li> the species for which fishing opportunities (total allowable catches and quotas) are set by Council under Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;
<li> the species under multiannual plans according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013;
<li> any important species on a regional or national scale for smallscale/local coastal fisheries.</li></ol></p>

Stocks of commercially exploited fish and shellfish species are exploited at levels which ensure long term sustainability and maintenance of sufficient reproductive capacity. Populations exhibit a healthy composition with regard to age and size distribution. Consistency to be maintained in accordance with the progressing reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, The associated targets outlined in the Initial Assessment (2013) were as follows:
<ul><li> Target fishing mortality to be at levels which aim to restore and maintain populations of harvested species at least at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), by 2015, where possible. Where stocks are managed within an agreed management plan, which is consistent with MSY in the long term, target fishing mortality as specified by the management plan should be adhered to;
<li> Target fishing mortality to be at levels which aim to restore and maintain populations of harvested species at least at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, by 2020, for all stocks. Where stocks are managed within an agreed management plan, which is consistent with MSY in the long term, target fishing mortality as specified by the management plan should be adhered to; 
<li> Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) should be within the range of biomasses which would be expected under fishing mortality equal to or below FMSY in the medium to long term and incorporate scientific uncertainty and natural variability;
<li> Size and age structure as measured by selected indicators reflect populations which are sustainably fished in the medium to long term and incorporate scientific uncertainty and natural variability.</li></ul></p>
<p>The environmental targets from the Initial Assessment (2013) have now been updated in light of the Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848 amending Commission Directive (EU) 2017/845. Ireland has now established the following environmental targets, based on the revised Common Fisheries Policy, Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, which stipulates that ""in order to reach the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks."" </p>
<p>Therefore, Ireland's environmental targets under Descriptor 3 are: 
<ul><li> Environmental Target D3T1: The Fishing mortality rate of populations of commercially-exploited species is at or below levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). </li>
<li>Environmental Target D3T2: The Spawning Stock Biomass of populations of commercially-exploited species are above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY).</li> </ul> </p>                                                          <p>The threshold value for the proportion of stocks required to be achieving GES is 100%, following Common Fisheries Policy Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, which stipulates that
<p><em>""in order to reach the objective of progressively restoring and maintaining populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield, the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate shall be achieved by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks."" </em><p/> </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "

The Celtic Seas ecoregion supports some of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. At least 8 major fishing nations currently have fisheries targeting the many marine stocks within this area. The greatest volume of landings is by Norway, UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Lesser amounts are landed by Germany, Spain and Belgium.</p>
<p>These fisheries target a large number of stocks. The pelagic fisheries, which account for the largest catches (by weight) in the region are the mid-water trawl fisheries for blue whiting, mackerel, horse mackerel, herring, boarfish, and sprat. The largest demersal fishery targets hake along the shelf edge using gillnets and longlines. There are also large mixed bottom-trawl fisheries targeting benthic species, Nephrops, and gadoids. The species composition of these mixed fisheries tends to vary, depending on the area and the countries involved in the fishery. In addition, there are many inshore fisheries which take place, inside 6-12 miles and mostly use static fishing gears.</p>
<p>Landings from nations such as Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark are dominated by pelagic species. Other nations within the EU target a combination of pelagic, demersal (including Nephrops), deep-water, and shellfish species. France has the highest reported effort. Effort levels for most countries show declining trends, with the most pronounced decline seen in Spanish effort.</p>
<p>The catches of pelagic species vary both spatially and temporally. Mackerel and blue whiting are caught mainly on their southward migrations along the shelf edge to spawning grounds in spring. The main international blue whiting fishery is around the Porcupine Bank. Mackerel and horse mackerel are caught throughout the ecoregion and catches are highest west of Ireland. Herring catches are concentrated in the Celtic Sea, and on the Donegal coast. The highest boarfish catches are in the western Celtic Sea. The albacore tuna fishery occurs in the southwestern part of Irish waters late in the season when effort extends north from the Bay of Biscay.</p>
<p>Hake are caught in deeper waters (> 70 m), along the continental shelf edge where the directed gillnet and longline fisheries occur. Anglerfish are also common throughout, with the highest catches on the shelf in the Celtic Sea. The highest megrim catches are in the western Celtic Sea. Whiting catches are highest in the Celtic Sea south of Ireland where there are also significant catches of haddock and cod. Pollack are mainly caught in inshore areas off Cornwall and along the southern coast of Ireland. The main Nephrops catches are in the western Irish Sea, the Aran Islands Ground, the Celtic Sea, and on the Porcupine Bank. Brown crab catches mainly occur off northwest Ireland.</p>
<p>Otter trawl is the main gear by effort used in demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea ecoregion. The species caught depends on the area, depth-range habitat, and season fished, as well as on the cod-end mesh size, but in all cases the catches consist of a mixture of different species.</p>
<p><em>Nephrops</em> is an important target species for otter trawls on discrete muddy grounds within the ecoregion. Vessels typically, although not exclusively, use twin- or quad-rig trawls with 80 mm cod-ends. A small wanted bycatch of fish species includes cod, haddock, plaice, anglerfish, and to a lesser extent sole. The use of selective gears (grids, square mesh, and separator panels) to reduce unwanted fish bycatch has increased over time. Mixed fisheries target both Nephrops and fin-fish in the Celtic Sea using a larger mesh size (100 mm or more).</p>
<p>Fin-fish are targeted with both small (80-99 mm) and larger (> 99 mm) mesh sizes in different parts of the ecoregion, depending on regulation and target assemblage. Smaller mesh otter trawls and seiners are typically used to target a broad mixture of species, including gadoids, flatfish, and other benthic species. These fisheries primarily occur within the Celtic Sea, along the slope west of Ireland and Scotland, and in the western English Channel. Large-mesh otter trawlers (typically 100 mm or 120 mm) tend to target gadoids, anglerfish, or rays.</p>
<p>Deep-water trawl fisheries are conducted in ICES subareas 6 and 7, principally by France, with some other participation, mainly Spanish. Trawling in waters deeper than 800 m, and gillnetting in waters deeper than 600m is prohibited by Regulation EC41/2007. This mixed deep-water trawl fishery mainly targets roundnose grenadier, black scabbardfish, and blue ling, with a bycatch mainly of smoothheads and deep-water sharks on the continental slope and offshore banks of subareas 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Beam trawlers operate on sandy grounds in the Irish and Celtic seas. The majority of the vessels use meshes in the range of 80-89 mm, and come from Belgium, the UK, and Ireland. In the Irish Sea, the vessels primarily target plaice and sole (although the sole fishery has declined significantly in the last decade).</p>
<p>There is also a fishery for ray species in the southern Irish Sea. In the Celtic Sea, the beam trawl fishery occurs on grounds where sole, anglerfish, cuttlefish, and megrim are abundant and the seabed is suitable for beam trawling. The fishery has bycatches of anglerfish, cod, haddock, and whiting.</p>
<p>The main gillnet fishery, (mainly with 120 mm mesh size) in this ecoregion targets hake along the continental slope. Spanish, French, UK, and Irish vessels are involved in the fishery, which typically operates at depths of 150-600 m. In the shallower Celtic Sea, where mesh sizes used are 120-219 mm, target species include anglerfish, flatfish, and gadoids.</p>
<p>A large number of inshore gillnetters (< 12 m) are also active in the Celtic Sea ecoregion. The target species and gears used tend to vary spatially and temporally. In the first quarter, the primary target of inshore gillnetters operating in divisions 7.g and southern 7.a is cod. Fisheries around the Irish coast seasonally target anglerfish, flatfish, pollack, and catsharks. Spanish-, French-, and UK-registered longliners target hake along the continental slope with bycatches of ling, blue ling, and other deepwater species.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, inshore fishing takes place inside 12 nm of the Irish coast, while fishing from the baselines to 6nm is limited to Irish and Northern Irish owned and operated vessels only. The Irish fleet is, currently divided into a number of sub-segments. The Polyvalent [Potting] Sub-segment consists of small vessels fishing exclusively by means of pots for crustaceans and whelk. The polyvalent [Scallop] Sub-segment consists of larger vessels target great scallop. The Polyvalent [under and over 18 m length] sub-segments consist of vessels targeting a broad range of species. Some of these vessels target the same stocks as offshore fleets.</p>
A new development in recent years has been the targeting of wrasse stocks, using pots, to supply cleaner fish which remove sea-lice from farmed salmon.   </p>                                                                                                          <h3>Pressures</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The predominant pressure exerted by fishing in Irish waters has been identified as extraction of or mortality/injury to wild species by commercial fishing.

ICES has evaluated the main impacts of fishing on the marine environment as extraction, abrasion and smothering.</p>
<p>Extraction of, or mortality/injury to, wild species by fishing and other activities impacts on food webs, benthos, populations of fish, seabirds and mammals. Such extraction of fish from a stock through fishing activities is measured as fishing mortality and is denoted ""F"". Fishing mortality should be at or below rates which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) to be consistent with D3C1 of the MSFD. This rate is termed F<sub>MSY</sub>. For stocks which are either at or at risk of being unable to reproduce themselves, fishing mortality must be reduced to below F<sub>MSY</sub>, to a rate consistent with recovery. The reproductive capability of a fish stock is measured as its spawning stock biomass, denoted ""SSB"". In some cases, state is determined by total biomass, if SSB cannot be ascertained. To be consistent with criterion D3C2, SSB must be above levels capable of producing MSY. If F is too high, SSB may not stabilise around levels that could support MSY.</p>
<p>Physical disturbance (abrasion and smothering) of the seabed by fishing impacts on marine habitats in general, on benthos and on marine productivity. Abrasion is associated with bottom-contacting mobile and set fishing activities, in particular scallop dredging, beam trawling, and otter trawling but also other activities such as anchoring and hydrodynamic dredging. Smothering refers to activities contributing to change in siltation on the seabed include dredging for shipping, disposal of materials to the seafloor, and commercial fishing.</p>
<p>ICES has previously advised zero catches in this ecoregion for stocks of rare or threatened species such as basking shark, porbeagle, angel shark, the common skate complex, white skates, undulate rays, orange roughy, deep-water sharks (kitefin shark, leafscale gulper shark, Portuguese dogfish), and greater silver smelt. These stocks have been either targeted or by-caught in fisheries in the past and are now depleted. Information on these stocks is sparse, but they require special management attention to conserve remaining populations.  </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <h3>Assessment Method</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The assessment is based on results of ICES or Marine Institute advice/additional assessments for individual stocks, giving results in terms of F (D3C1) and SSB (D3C2). All stocks which have a landings value recorded in the FAO FISHSTAT database were included, if the stock occurs the Irish MSFD area. In a few cases additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the status of stocks which have not previously been advised upon by either the MI or ICES. However, no additional assessments were performed for any stock which was already assessed by ICES, even if ICES classified the stock as unknown.</p>
<p>ICES provides advice on fishing mortality and SSB reference points F<sub>MSY</sub> and MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. F<sub>MSY</sub> is estimated as the fishing mortality with a given fishing pattern and current environmental conditions that gives the long-term maximum yield. MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> is the lower bound of spawning-stock biomass fluctuation when fished at F<sub>MSY</sub>. The approach does not use a B<sub>MSY</sub> estimate. B<sub>MSY</sub> is a notional value around which stock size fluctuates when fishing at F<sub>MSY</sub>. Determination of MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> requires contemporary data with fishing at F<sub>MSY</sub> to identify the normal range of fluctuations in biomass when stocks are fished at this fishing mortality rate. When sufficient observations of SSB fluctuations associated with fishing around F<sub>MSY</sub> are available, the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> should be re-estimated to correspond to the lower bound of the range of stock sizes associated with MSY.</p>
<p>For all shellfish stocks other than <em>Nephrops</em> stocks the Marine Institute analyses were used to populate this assessment. These analyses are presented in the Review of Shellfish Stocks 2018. Two methods are used to establish F in relation to F<sub>MSY</sub>, spawning potential ratio (SPR) or harvest ratio (HR). SPR defines the ratio of spawning under current (likely) fishing mortality rate to that of an unexploited stock (Bo). Limit and target reference points for SPR are generally accepted to be 0.1 and 0.35 respectively based on meta-analysis of fish stocks response to exploitation. Hence 0.35*SPRBo corresponds to B<sub>MSY</sub>. Where the SPR is not defined analytically it can be described by the relationship between size at maturity and size at first capture (Minimum Landing Size or Minimum Conservation Reference Size, MCRS) especially where discard mortality is negligible as is the case for most shellfish. All shellfish have an MCRS which is designed to enable some spawning escapement and which provides for a given SPR. HR or catch biomass ratio, is the proportion of the biomass, removed annually. HR corresponding to F<sub>MSY</sub> will vary between stocks i.e. some species can sustain higher levels of F or HR than others. For stocks where reference points are unavailable the sustainable HR is unknown. In these cases, the response of the stock to the HRs, and which are controlled by TAC, are monitored over time and adapted.</p>
<p>For non-ICES shellfish stocks, stock biomass can be described directly from surveys, where such surveys provide estimates of absolute biomass, and by proxies such as biomass indicators from surveys or catch per unit effort (CPUE) from commercial data. The stock status relative to B<sub>MSY</sub> is not generally known but proxies could include trends in surveys or CPUE and comparison of current or recent position against long term trends. This should, however, be qualified given that the historic trend is likely to already represent an exploited stock time series and true Bo (unexploited) or B<sub>MSY</sub> remains unknown. These time series can also be analysed using various stock assessment procedures and may provide estimates of B<sub>MSY</sub>.</p>
<p>For a small number of stocks not assessed by either ICES or the MI through its shellfish assessments, survey trend analyses were performed. The reference point used in these analyses was the relationship between survey abundance over time versus the long term average, following Commission Decision 2017/848 concerning the determination of GES. Those stocks above the average were considered to be have achieved GES.</p>
<p>The assessment was carried out for 177 stocks/species of fish, crustaceans and shellfish. Of the stocks in Irish waters, 18% were found to have achieved GES while the environmental status of 59% of stocks is unknown. A further 22% of stocks were found not to have achieved GES.</p>
<p>ICES advises that the data currently collected on fish length for stock assessment purposes is suitable to assess the size distribution of a stock (D3C3) but that until the proof of concept has been validated, D3C3 is not operational for MSFD assessment purposes.  </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <h3>Assessment Result</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>The assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES) of commercial fish stocks is based on whether stocks are fished at or below a rate consistent with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and whether their SSB is above the level that can produce MSY.</p>
<p>For pelagic fish, 3 stocks were found to have achieved GES, 5 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 6 stocks is currently unknown. Among the pelagic stocks that have achieved GES are albacore tuna, swordfish and Irish Sea herring. Among the stocks not achieving GES are mackerel, blue whiting and western horse mackerel. Horse mackerel met criterion D3C1 (F&#8804F<sub>MSY</sub>) but not D3C2 (SSB > MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>). In contrast, mackerel and blue whiting met criterion D3C2 but not D3C1. Some stocks not meeting criterion D3C2 were experiencing recruitment impairment (e.g. herring in ICES Sub-area 6a and herring in the Celtic Sea). Bluefin tuna met D3C1 but was unknown in relation to D3C2 and hence unknown in relation to the achievement of GES. Others stocks were unknown under either criterion; these include sprat, pilchard and boarfish.</p>
<p>For demersal fish, 10 stocks were found to have achieved GES, 18 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 18 stocks is currently unknown. Among those stocks that have achieved GES are northern hake, saithe in ICES Sub-areas 4, 6 and 3a and megrim in ICES Sub-areas 4 and 6a. Of the stocks not achieving GES, whiting in the Irish Sea, cod and sole in the Celtic Sea and plaice off southwest Ireland did not meet either assessment criterion. Stocks not meeting criterion D3C1 included haddock off NW Ireland, megrim in the Celtic Sea and Biscay, whiting and haddock in the Celtic Sea. Stocks not meeting criterion D3C2 included sea bass in ICES Sub-area 4bc, 7a, and 7d-h, cod and sole in the Irish Sea. Among the stocks of unknown environmental status were plaice, sea bass and sole off the northwest of Ireland. Anglerfish in the Celtic Sea and Biscay met criterion D3C1, but was unknown in relation to D3C2.</p>
<p>Of demersal shellfish stocks, 10 were found to have achieved GES, 4 stocks have not achieved GES and the environmental status of 8 stocks is currently unknown. GES was achieved for most <em>Nephrops</em> stocks with the exception of the Aran grounds stock, whilst the environmental status of Nephrops on the Porcupine grounds is currently unknown overall but it did not meet D3C1. Edible crab stocks met criterion D3C1, but were unknown for D3C2.

Most razor clam stocks have achieved GES, though most
lobster and native oyster stocks have not done so. Many lobster stocks met criterion D3C2 but not D3C1. In contrast most native oyster stocks met D3C1 but not D3C2.</p>
<p>Of the elasmobranch stocks being commercially exploited, the environmental status of most stocks (n=16) was found to be currently unknown.

In the case of some stocks or species, it may never be possible to assess their environmental status in relation to GES. This is particularly challenging for cephalopod stocks, which are not easily assessed because they are so short-lived and are subject to fluctuations driven by environmental changes. Further work is also required to assess the status of some coastal fish (e.g. wrasse), which are currently unassessed.</p>
<p>Apart from coastal stocks, almost all stocks in this assessment are exploited by more than one country. In order to assess progress towards achievement or maintenance of GES for these shared stocks, the assessments need to be undertaken in an international forum such as ICES. For the coastal stocks, work is ongoing at a national level on determining their life history parameters, quantification of catch and assessment of sustainable exploitation rates.</p>
<p>More work and international cooperation is required to analyse if age and size distribution metrics available for populations of commercially exploited species are indicative of healthy populations (i.e. Criterion D3C3).</p>              <h3>Data Sources</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. 2018.

Mixed Fisheries,,"<h3> FEAS Advice for 2018 </h3>
<p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice as a tool for management of
demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea. However, the current modelling procedure used to
produce this advice is under development. The methodology and underlying assumptions
need to be investigated further. Therefore mixed fisheries catch option scenarios provided by
ICES, can only be viewed as preliminary and should not be used to set the TACs for cod,
haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea.</p><hr/>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p>Fisheries in the Celtic Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a
variety of different gears. Therefore, in line with the operational nature of the fishery, ICES now produces
mixed-fisheries scenarios for the Celtic Sea. This advice sheet highlights the potential implications of single stock
management on the catches of multiple stocks caught together in mixed-fisheries. The species considered within
this advice are cod (27.7.e-k), haddock (27.7.b-k) and whiting (27.7.b-c & e-k).</p>
<p>Past fishing patterns, catchability of fleets and single species TAC advice are used to produce a quantitative
forecast of over- and under- exploitation of the different stocks given their mixed fishery interactions. Forecasts
are summarised in a range of potential management scenarios.</p>
<p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts produced for 2018 indicate that the most limiting stocks (i.e. the stock where the
first quota is reached for most fleets) in the Celtic Sea gadoid mixed fisheries will be haddock. Under the
scenarios presented for 2018 a significant change to the exploitation pattern for haddock would be required to
avoid overexploitation.</p>
<h3> Summary of Scenarios </h3>
<p>Eight mixed-fisheries forecast scenarios were produced for the Celtic Sea, all of which are defined and detailed
within the ICES advice sheet. Scenarios that result in under- or overutilization of stock are useful in identifying
imbalance between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks. They indicate in which direction fleets may
have to adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing
opportunities. Here follows a brief summary of the outcomes of these scenarios for 2018 and their associated
landings (Table 1):
<li> The ''minimum'' scenario indicates that haddock is the most limiting stock (representing 64% of effort in
2016). This scenario assumes that the discard ban is strictly implemented for each fleet and fishing stops
when the catch of a fleet reaches its quota share of any of the three stocks.
<li> The ''maximum'' scenario gives very similar results to the ''whiting'' scenario, indicating that whiting is
the least limiting quota. The maximum scenario assumes that there is no limit on discarding and each
fleet continues fishing until they exhaust their quota share of all the stocks.
<li> Only the ''minimum'' and ''haddock'' scenarios meet the objective of all stocks being fished at or below
F<sub>MSY</sub>. The haddock scenario assumes that fishing stops when a fleet reaches its quota share of haddock.
This implies reducing effort levels by 42% compared to those observed in 2016.
<li> The ''range'' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future. It utilises
the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery. That option results in an F
for haddock close to the upper limit of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range. The F for cod slightly below F<sub>MSY</sub> and the F for
whiting well below F<sub>MSY</sub> and close to the lower bound of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range. The resulting biomass
projections in 2019 are above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> for all three stocks and are therefore can be considered safe
harvesting practices in the short term.</p>
<p>WGMIXFISH produces advice based on catch per mixed-fisheries scenarios in 2018. In total there are 8
scenarios, maximum, minimum, COD, HAD, WHG, status quo effort, value and range. All scenarios are
described in detail in the attached advice sheet. Here FEAS has convert that catch advice given in Table 2 into
approximate landings (tonnes) estimates for each stock and each scenario in the table below. The official ICES
landings for 2016 and the single species advice for 2018 have been included for comparative purposes.</p>","<h3>FEAS Advice for 2019</h3>
<p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice as a tool for management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea. However, the current modelling procedure used to produce the advice is under development. The methodology and underlying assumptions need to be investigated further. Therefore, mixed fisheries catch option scenarios provided by ICES, can only be viewed as preliminary and should not be used to set TACs for cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea. </p><hr/>

This advice sheet highlights the potential implications of single stock management on the catches of multiple stocks caught together in mixed-fisheries.

<h3>Summary of Scenarios</h3>
<p>Eight mixed-fisheries forecast scenarios were produced for the Celtic Sea, all of which are defined and detailed within the attached ICES advice sheet. Scenarios that result in under- or over-utilization of stock are useful in identifying imbalance between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks. They indicate in which direction fleets may have to adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. Here follows a brief summary of the outcomes of these scenarios for 2019:
<li>The results show that in 2019 it is not possible to achieve all management objectives simultaneously, as no catch of haddock or whiting is consistent with the cod single species advice of zero catch. The 'minimum' scenario confirms that this mismatch is due to the fact that all fleets operating within the Celtic Sea catch cod to some extent, resulting in cod being a ""choke"" species for haddock and whiting. Therefore, the 'minimum' scenario results in zero catch of all three gadoids. 
<li>This year an additional scenario of cod catches under the MSY approach ('cod_F<sub>MSY</sub>') is presented. The low value of F (0.12) under the cod MSY approach (assuming a non-zero catch) results in substantial undershoots of both haddock and whiting, as fishing is stopped when the cod quota is reached. 
<li>The 'maximum' scenario gives very similar results to the 'whiting' scenario, indicating that whiting is the least limiting quota. The maximum scenario assumes that there is no limit on discarding and each fleet continues fishing until they exhaust their quota share of all the stocks. 
<li>The 'range' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future.  It utilises the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery.  The outcomes of this scenario are driven by the restrictive nature of the cod advice this year, with the minimum of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range advice for haddock and whiting resulting from the need to reduce cod catches to a minimum.</p>","<h3>FEAS Advice for 2020</h3>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice to inform the management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea.

<h3>Summary of Scenarios</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the mixed fisheries advice has comprised Celtic Sea cod (27.7.e-k), haddock (27.7.b-k) and whiting (27.7.b-c & e-k) in eight mixed-fisheries forecast scenarios.  These scenarios are defined by the species and TAC incorporated into the model, determining under- or over-utilization of stock, which is useful in identifying imbalance amongst the fishing opportunities of the stocks.  They indicate the direction in which fleets may best adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities, without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities.  The 'range' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future.  It utilises the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery.  For 2020 outcomes are driven by the restrictive nature of the cod advice, with the minimum of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range advice for haddock and whiting resulting from the need to reduce catches of cod to a minimum.</p>
<p>This year the ICES Working Group on Mixed Fisheries Advice continued to explore and test the possibility of expanding the number of species included in the Celtic Sea mixed fisheries analysis. A mixed fishery model for the Irish sea is being developed, and it is hoped to provide mixed fishery catch options for the Irish sea in the future. Priority for inclusion is being given to target species of economic importance for which category 1 assessments are available.  The principle challenges faced when incorporating new species are aligning the single species assessments with multi-area and multispecies TACs.  This is further complicated by varying assumptions of species mixing within individual stocks.</p>  
<h3>Future Direction </h3>
<p>A scoping meeting will be held with advice recipients and stakeholders at ICES HQ in early March 2020 to discuss the next generation and future of WGMIXFISH advice.  This meeting aims to review recent scientific developments, modelling and visualization, to create awareness of what is currently achievable, and identify potential approaches, content and presentation of this advice in the future.  </p>
<h3>ICES Technical Service on Bycatch Stocks</h3><p>The EU requested ICES to provide likely catches in 2020 of bycatch/non-targeted stocks that have zero catch advice (cod in divisions 7.e-k and 6.a and in Subdivision 21, whiting in divisions 6.a and 7.a, and plaice in divisions 7.h and 7.j-k).</p>  

<p>The commission wanted to know what the bycatch of these stocks would be under scenarios of the MSY range from the WWMAP, and assuming that selective gear was adopted by the fleets. The analyses conducted by ICES highlights some shortcomings where the tool used cannot be easily applied when the assessments are qualitative.  It is not possible to accurately predict the impact of a change in fisher behaviour in adopting more selective gear, because data on this was not available. Notwithstanding these shortcomings the analyses for Celtic sea cod and plaice, Irish sea whiting and west of Scotland cod and whiting, gives the likely bycatches of these stocks under catch scenarios for the target species.</p>

Seven mixed fisheries scenarios and a ""range scenario"" are provided. They indicate the direction in which fleets may best adapt to fully utilize their catch opportunities, without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities.  The 'range' scenario may provide a good basis for mixed fisheries management in the future.  It utilises the MSY ranges to minimise the mixed fisheries imbalances in the fishery.  However, because fishing mortality is constrained within the MSY ranges this scenario can only be achieved with changes in fishing patterns, which are kept constant in all the other scenarios. All outcomes are driven by the restrictive nature of the cod advice for 2021.</p><h4>Mixed-fisheries advice for divisions 7.b-c and 7.e-k (Celtic Sea)</h4><p>Mixed-fisheries considerations combine single-species stock assessments with information on the average catch composition and fishing effort of the fleets catching cod, haddock, whiting, Norway lobster, sole, white anglerfish, and megrim in the Celtic Sea. The mixed-fisheries results shown for Norway lobster are combined over several FUs in plots, but stock status and fishing opportunities differ across FUs. In the absence of specific mixed-fisheries management objectives, ICES does not advise on specific mixed-fisheries catch opportunities for the individual stocks.</p><p>Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on the central assumption that the fishing patterns and catchability of a fleet in 2021 are the same as the average patterns in recent years (2017-2019). A total of seven scenarios are presented, corresponding to different fleet behaviours for 2021 (Table 1, bottom of page). The forecasted scenarios are presented in terms of catch and the potential for quota over- and undershoot, which is driven by the most and the least restrictive single-stock advice.</p><p>All fleets in the Celtic Sea catch cod, and cod is the most limiting stock in this area. The 2021 forecast with the cod catch advice at zero implies that catches of the other stocks would also be zero (the ""min"" scenario). Because the zero catch for cod results in the same outcome as the ""min"" scenario, the cod scenario is not presented here. To provide a scenario with non-zero catch, a reduced cod F<sub>MSY</sub> scenario is presented (""cod_F<sub>AR</sub>MSY""), based on the ICES advice rule, which gives an F value of 0.147 for cod and results in undershoots for all other stocks, as fishing is stopped when the cod quota is reached. The ""max"" scenario, assumes that all fleets catch all their quotas irrespective of the economic viability of doing so and is intended to represent the maximum potential catch; this scenario leads to an overshoot for all stocks, as individual fleets are least limited by different stocks.</p><p>An additional ""range"" scenario minimizes the potential mismatch between the advised fishing mortality in the single-stock advice for 2021 and a fishing mortality which takes into account the technical interactions between stocks in mixed-fisheries by setting target fishing levels within the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges. This scenario estimates fishing mortality by stock which, if used for setting single-stock fishing opportunities for 2021, may reduce the gap between the most and least restrictive TACs, thus reducing the potential quota over- and undershoot. This scenario was run using a reduced F<sub>MSY</sub> range when stock size is below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> for cod (F<sub>MSY</sub> range 0.086-0.208) and whiting (F<sub>MSY</sub> range 0.222-0.268) and the full range for the other stocks. The scenario results in fishing mortality for cod at the upper end of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range, with all other stocks being at or close to the lowest bound of their respective F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges. Norway lobster is not included in this ""range"" scenario.<h4>Catch scenarios</h4><p>Mixed-fisheries scenarios consider the implications of mixed fisheries operating under single-stock TAC regimes, taking into account the fishing patterns of the various fleets in 2017-2019 (i.e. the catchability for the different stocks and effort distribution among mtiers as well as access to quota). The scenarios presented here do not assume either any quota balancing in the forecast through changes in targeting behaviour in 2021 or any change in the selection pattern of the fleets. The ""min"" scenario is consistent with a full implementation of the EU landing obligation given the individual single stock advice. In 2021, the ""min"" scenario shows that cod limits all fleets due to the zero catch advice for cod and that all fleets catch cod to a greater or lesser extent. The ""max"" scenario demonstrates the upper bound of potential fleet effort and stock catches, in that it assumes all fleets continue fishing until all their stock shares for all stocks are exhausted, irrespective of the economic viability of such actions. In 2021, the ""max"" scenario indicated that fleets have different least limiting stocks which results in over-quota catches of all stocks. Sole is the least limiting stock for the highest number of fleets (six of the 24 fleets, representing 43% of the effort in 2019), while the different Norway lobster functional units are collectively the least limiting quota for 14 of the 24 fleets (representing 42% of the effort in 2019).</p><p>Scenarios that result in under- or overutilisation are useful in identifying imbalance between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks. They indicate the direction in which fleets may have to adapt to fully utilise their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. Under the scenarios presented here, the ""max"" scenario suggests that if all fleets' stock shares are to be fully utilized, catches of all stocks would be higher than advised in the single-stock advice. This indicates that not all fleets are limited by the same stock. However, as all fleets catch cod to a greater or lesser extent, any fishing effort directed at other stocks is likely to result in catches of cod above the single-stock advice (zero catch) which is considered not precautionary. The ""cod_F<sub>AR</sub>MSY"" scenario, where the cod TAC is set at reduced v, results in catches of cod and underutilization of all other single-stock TACs. Under this scenario fleets would be required to reduce their effort by 87%. The status quo effort scenario (""sq_E"") results in full utilization of most stocks, small overshoots of haddock and megrims, and large overshoots of cod and whiting. In the absence of a full economic behaviour model, a ""val"" scenario balances fishing opportunities by stock with their potential market value. For 2021, the ""val"" scenario gives results that are close to the <em>status quo</em> effort scenario.</p><p>Mixed-fisheries catch scenarios can take specific management priorities into account, and these results indicate that it is not possible to achieve all single species management objectives simultaneously. ICES single-stock advice for demersal stocks considered here is based on the EU multiannual plan (MAP) for demersal stocks in the western waters (EU, 2019), except for nep.out.7 (which is based on the precautionary approach). ICES provides zero-catch advice for cod in 2021, based on precautionary considerations. The ""max"", ""sq_E"", ""val"", and ""had.27.7b-k"" scenarios all result in cod being fished above F<sub>lim</sub> (1.130) in 2021. All demersal fish stocks are fished above F<sub>MSY</sub> under the ""max"" scenario, while all but monkfish and sole are fished above F<sub>MSY</sub> under the ""sq_E"" and val scenarios.</p><p>A ""range"" scenario as described in Ulrich <em>et al.</em> (2017) searches for the minimum sum of differences between potential catches by stock under the ""min"" and the ""max"" scenarios within the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges. The outcomes of this scenario are driven by the restrictive nature of the cod advice this year, with the minimum of the F<sub>MSY</sub> range advice for all other stocks resulting from the need to reduce cod catches to a minimum. The results are presented as outcomes of single stock forecasts using the identified range of fishing mortalities and do not take account of the technical interactions as for the mixed fishery scenarios. This implies that the catches forecasted within the ""range"" scenario could only be achieved with substantial changes in fishing patterns.<h4>Quality considerations</h4><p>The quality of catch data, disaggregated by mtier, has improved in recent years. This is due to the single ICES data call, which combines data needs and ensures common data storage in InterCatch and Accessions. In spite of the improvements made over time, and in particular the issuing of a specific data call, the compilation of the mixed-fisheries dataset remains a highly demanding process, combining several types of data provided by different sources and covering a large number of countries, stocks, and fishing activities. Various changes and updates in the data sources occur every year. Quality control is a major component of the work performed and is considered suitable for providing advice. </p><p>Mixed-fisheries projections for the Celtic Seas ecoregion are based on full analytical single-stock assessments. Single-stock forecasts are also reproduced independently as part of the mixed-fisheries analyses, allowing additional quality control of both processes. The quality of the individual forecasts of the single-stocks will affect the quality of the mixed-fish scenarios. For the mixed-fisheries advice, the intermediate year assumption used was the same as that used for the single-stock forecasts. This ensures consistency between the single-stock advice and the stock specific mixed-fisheries advice for that stock (i.e. haddock catches are the same under the haddock scenario as for the single-stock advice). As for the single stock advice the mixed-fisheries scenarios for cod will be very sensitive to the assumptions on catch in 2020 and on the recruitment for 2020 and 2021.</p><p>A key assumption in the projections is that catchability by stock and mtier and effort distribution (relative proportion of time spent by each fleet in the various mtiers) in 2020 and 2021 remain constant at their recent mean level (2017-2019). In reality, fishing patterns may change over time - particularly in response to significant changes in policy, such as the implementation of the landing obligation and revision of technical measures. In practice, such changes could affect the outcomes of mixed-fisheries projections. The year range used as a recent mean (2017-2019) covers the period during which the EU landing obligation has been introduced so the data reflect changes in fishing pattern over this period. It has not been possible to predict further changes in fishing pattern over the projection period.</p><p>The current model has been expanded this year to include three additional demersal fish stocks (megrim, anglerfish and sole) in addition to the Norway lobster Functional Units in the Celtic Sea. It has not yet been possible to include hake, which is also important in the mixed fisheries, due to technical difficulties. </p><p>Differences in stock distributions mean that spatial decoupling of catches of cod, haddock and whiting from those of megrims, anglerfishes and sole could be achieved (Dolder <em>et al.</em>, 2020). </p><h4>Methods and data</h4><p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on the single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on species composition in catches in the Celtic Seas fisheries (Moore <em>et al.</em>, 2020), using the F<sub>cube</sub> method (Ulrich <em>et al.</em>, 2011, 2017). Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on central assumptions that fishing patterns and catchability in the TAC year are the same as those in recent years (2017-2019).</p><p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts include full analytical single-stock assessments for the following stocks: cod, haddock, whiting, megrim, anglerfish, and sole; as well as five Norway lobster functional units with underwater TV surveys for absolute estimates of abundance.</p><p>The TACs for anglerfish and megrims cover two species of each (for anglerfish: <em>L. piscatorius</em> and <em>L. budegassa</em>; for megrims: <em>L. whiffiagonis</em> and <em>L. boscii</em>) but only the first of these two species in each case have full analytical assessments and are included in the mixed fisheries catch advice. For anglerfish this is considered to be 78% of catches in Subarea 7 (ICES, 2020a) and for megrims it is considered to be 95% of catches from each area, so the majority of the TAC derived from these stocks are included. Methods for data-limited stocks are under development which may allow the other species to be considered in future.</p><p>For Norway lobster only part of the TAC area (Subarea 7) is covered by the advice. For the mixed-fisheries projections it was assumed that 48% of the landings come from divisions 7.b-k (average proportion from 2000 to 2019). </p><p>The mixed-fisheries scenarios and forecasts are produced using data requested as part of an ICES data call, issued formally under EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) regulations. This provides consistency in catch and effort totals. Additionally, separate data files containing total weight of landings and effort in kW-days by fleet and mtier are requested. Fleet and mtier categories used in the mixed-fisheries analysis are based on DCF level 4 and 5 categories, respectively. Grouping across categories has been performed to aggregate over ""small"" mtiers (defined as mtiers with less than 1.0% landed in 2019 for each of the stocks considered).</p><p>Total landings (2019) of all species considered in the mixed-fishery advice were 56 804 tonnes, with:<ul><li> ~79% landed by otter trawls and seines;</li><li> ~ 10% landed by beam trawls;</li><li> ~ 3% by gill- and trammelnets; </li><li> ~ 8 % by other gears.</li></ul></p><p>Total discards (not shown in the plot) were 9326 tonnes (14% by weight of total catch).</p> <h4>Issues relevant for the advice</h4><p>The model includes two stocks (mon.27.78abd and meg.27.7b-k8abd) that are also included in the mixed fisheries advice for the Bay of Biscay. Catches of these stocks outside of the Celtic Sea are included in the model as an ""OTH"" fleet and are subject to the same fleet behaviour assumptions (e.g. ""min"", ""max""). Therefore, the outcomes for mon.27.78abd and meg.27.7b-k8abd can only be considered representative in the context of Celtic Sea stocks. There may be inconsistencies between the catch forecasts in scenarios in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay mixed-fisheries advice; in future years, consideration will be given to splitting the presented catch advice between the respective areas.</p>

,,"<h3>Future Direction</h3>
<p>WGMIXFISH will continue work to incorporate other stocks such as plaice, sole and <em>Nephrops</em> stocks into
mixed fisheries forecast in the future. The validity of some of the underlying assumptions, especially the fixed
catchability assumption, needs to be evaluated fully for the Celtic Sea. Management strategy evaluations should
be carried out to assess the performance of mixed fisheries forecasts. Additionally there will be continued
efforts to advance the forecasting capabilities of the model though streamlining of inputs and comparing this
approach with other methods.</p>","<h3>Future Direction</h3>
<p>This year the ICES working on Working Group on Mixed Fisheries Advice explored and tested the possibility of expanding the number of species included in the Celtic Sea mixed fisheries considerations. Priority for inclusion was given to target species, of economic importance, for which a category 1 assessments are available. The outcome of this exploration demonstrated that it was possible to incorporate five new species: <em>Nephrops</em>, hake, anglerfish, megrim, and sole. The principle challenges faced when incorporating theses new species are aligning single species assessments, with multi-area and multispecies TACs. Which is further complicated by varying assumptions of species mixing within individual stocks. </p>

<p>Further work is needed to validate some of the underlying assumptions of the mixed fisheries forecasts. There will be continued efforts to advance the forecasting capabilities of the model though streamlining of inputs and comparing this approach with other methods.  Finally, there will be continued efforts to develop the presentation of mixed fisheries advice, improving accessibility for end-users.  </p>","<h3>Future Direction </h3>
<p>A scoping meeting will be held with advice recipients and stakeholders at ICES HQ in early March 2020 to discuss the next generation and future of WGMIXFISH advice.  This meeting aims to review recent scientific developments, modelling and visualization, to create awareness of what is currently achievable, and identify potential approaches, content and presentation of this advice in the future.  </p>
<h3>ICES Technical Service on Bycatch Stocks</h3><p>The EU requested ICES to provide likely catches in 2020 of bycatch/non-targeted stocks that have zero catch advice (cod in divisions 7.e-k and 6.a and in Subdivision 21, whiting in divisions 6.a and 7.a, and plaice in divisions 7.h and 7.j-k).</p>  

<p>The commission wanted to know what the bycatch of these stocks would be under scenarios of the MSY range from the WWMAP, and assuming that selective gear was adopted by the fleets. The analyses conducted by ICES highlights some shortcomings where the tool used cannot be easily applied when the assessments are qualitative.  It is not possible to accurately predict the impact of a change in fisher behaviour in adopting more selective gear, because data on this was not available. Notwithstanding these shortcomings the analyses for Celtic sea cod and plaice, Irish sea whiting and west of Scotland cod and whiting, gives the likely bycatches of these stocks under catch scenarios for the target species.</p>

Scenarios should therefore also be produced that give, as a minimum, a stable biomass and increasing biomass if F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges do not. This may involve carrying out mixed fisheries forecast or providing F-multipliers consistent with the advice for the target stocks or where forecasts are not possible the catch scenario should be based on the best available scientific information.

The zero-catch advice provided by ICES for this stock is based on precautionary considerations. The mixed-fisheries analysis shows that cod is caught in most mixed fisheries in the Celtic Sea with other species for which non-zero catches are advised. The present technical service provides illustrative catch scenarios consistent with the lower F<sub>MSY</sub> range for haddock and the reduced F<sub>MSY</sub> advised for whiting as detailed below.</p><p>For cod in divisions 7.e-k: <ul><li>2548 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at  F<sub>MSY</sub>; this would result in a cod spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 2410 tonnes in 2022;</li><li>1856 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at  F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 3377 tonnes in 2022;</li><li>2231 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished midway between  F<sub>MSY</sub> and F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 2851 tonnes in 2022;</li><li>1669 tonnes are estimated to be caught when whiting is fished the reduced F<sub>MSY</sub> advised (i.e.  F<sub>MSY</sub>  SSB<sub>2021</sub>/MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>); this would result in a cod SSB of 3642 tonnes in 2022.</li></ul></p><p>Only the haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>and whiting reduced F<sub>MSY</sub> scenarios result in an increase in cod SSB relative to 2021 (2943 tonnes). All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (4200 tonnes) in 2022.</p><p>It is not possible to provide catch scenarios that include changes in the fishing pattern. The above scenarios assume a fixed fishing pattern in 2021. Future changes in the fishing pattern depend on management measures and the response of the fishery, which cannot be predicted by ICES.</p><p>Since cod are bycaught in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p><h4>Cod in Division 6.a and whiting in Division 6.a and 7.a</h4><p>ICES has provided estimates of the likely catches of several stocks under the assumption that TACs for the target stocks are set in line with ICES advice.<ul><li> For cod in Division 6.a, catches in 2021 are estimated to be between 1625 tonnes and1914 tonnes, based on the fishing mortality reductions advised for saithe and based on the current fishing mortality. Under these scenarios, spawningstock biomass (SSB) in 2022 is expected to increase by 1730%.</li>
<li> For whiting in Division 6.a, it is not possible to forecast catches in 2021 or stock development. Catches in 2019 were estimated at 1444 tonnes.</li>
<li> For whiting in Division 7.a, forecasted bycatch levels in 2021 are 930 tonnes, using a model of whiting bycatch in the <em>Nephrops</em> fishery and assuming 7300 tonnes of <em>Nephrops</em> catches in 2021. This is expected to result in a 7% increase in SSB in 2022.</li></ul></p>
