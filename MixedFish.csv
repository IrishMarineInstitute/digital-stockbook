<p><strong>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice to inform the management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea.  Mixed-fisheries considerations combine single-species stock assessments with information on the average catch composition and fishing effort of the fleets catching cod, haddock, whiting, Norway lobster, sole, white anglerfish, and megrim in the Celtic Sea.

<p>ICES provide a number of illustrative scenarios. For example, the status quo effort is analogous to business as usual.  Under this scenario there would be significant catches of cod and whiting above the single stock advice leading to further depletion of those stocks.</strong> </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Fisheries in the Celtic Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a variety of different gears.

<h4><b>Mixed-fisheries considerations</b> </h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are presented for cod (cod.27.7e-k), haddock (had.27.7b-k), whiting (whg.27.7b-ce-k), Norway lobster (functional units [FUs] 16, 17, 19, 20-21, 22, and 27.7 outside FUs), two sole stocks (western English channel, sol.27.7e and Celtic Sea, sol.27.7fg), white and black-bellied anglerfish (mon.27.78abd and ank.27.78abd), megrim (meg.27.7b-k8abd) and hake (hke.27.3a46-8abd) in the Celtic Sea.</p>
<p>Given the single-stock catch advice for 2024, the most limiting stocks for demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea are cod and whiting, with 27 of 35 defined fleets reaching their cod and whiting quotas with a lower effort than for the other stocks, and three further fleets reaching their cod quote with a lower effort than for other stocks. This is due to the zero catch advice for cod and whiting and the fact that almost all fisheries operating with demersal gears catch these stocks. The least limiting stock is Norway lobster in FU 20-21 (18 fleets) followed by black-bellied anglerfish (16 fleets). It is assumed that fleet fishing patterns in the forecast years are the same as observed in the recent past.</p><p>Mixed fisheries projections are conducted for six scenarios corresponding to different assumptions on the future effort deployment by the fleets (Table 1). The trade-offs in catches and any potential for overshoot and undershoot of the single-stock advice associated with each scenario are shown (Figure 1).</p>

MF_3,"<h4><b>Catch scenarios</b></h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries analyses consider the implications of mixed fisheries operating under single-stock catch advice regimes given that there are no changes in the quota shares of the fleets for the different stocks, in the proportion of effort per m&#233tiers for each fleet, in discard rates or catchability in the m&#233tiers during the forecast period compared to the most recent data years (2020-2022). Scenario assumptions for the intermediate year (2023) and forecast year (2024) are listed in Table 2. These assumptions may differ from those used in the single stock forecasts.</p><p>A total of six scenarios are presented, corresponding to different effort constraints for 2024 (Table 1). The forecasted scenarios are presented in terms of catch and the potential for catch advice over - and undershoot, which is driven by the most and the least restrictive single-stock advice (Figure 1 and Table 3). Scenario results for fishing mortality (F) in 2024 and spawning stock biomass in 2025 are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.</p><p>Scenarios that result in under - or overshoot are useful in identifying the main mismatches between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks, where limiting catch advice can create potential ""choke species"" effects at fleet level. They indicate the direction in which fleets may have to adapt their fishing behaviour to more fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. Estimates of effort required by each fleet segment to reach its ""share"" of each single-stock advice are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>The ""min"" scenario is consistent with a full implementation of a landing obligation (without any exemptions) given the individual single stock advice (Table 3, Figure 1). In 2024, the ""min"" scenario shows that cod limits 30 of the 35 fleets; 27 of these fleets will also choke on whiting. This is due to the zero catch advice for cod and whiting and that almost all fleets catch cod and whiting to a greater or lesser extent. The five remaining fleets had no cod or whiting landings and so were limited by white anglerfish (two fleets), haddock, Celtic Sea sole, and Norway lobster outside of functional units respectively (Figure 2).</p><p>The ""max"" scenario shows the upper bound of potential fleet effort and stock catches (Table 3, Figure 1) in that it assumes all fleets continue fishing until all their stock shares for all stocks are exhausted irrespective of economic viability, legality, or fleet capacity. In 2024, the ""max"" scenario indicated that fleets have different least limiting stocks, which results in over-quota catches of all stocks (Figure 2). Norway lobster FU 20-21 (18 fleets), black-bellied anglerfish (16 fleets), and western English Channel sole (one fleet) are the least limiting stocks.</p><p>The status quo effort ""sq_E"" scenario sets the effort of each fleet in the forecast years equal to the average of the effort in the most recent three years for which data are available (2020 - 2022). This scenario investigates the mixed fisheries outcomes if the situation remains the same in terms of total effort and effort allocation among m&#233tiers. For 2024, this scenario results in large catch overshoots above the single-stock advice of cod and whiting, a small overshoot of haddock and western English Channel sole, small undershoots of white and black-bellied anglerfish, hake, megrim, and Norway lobster, and full uptake of Celtic Sea sole (Table 3, Figure 1).</p><p>The ""min_range"" scenario explores how the higher catch options associated with the F<sub>MSY upper</sub> or scaled F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points (for stocks where ranges are defined) may reduce choking behaviour in mixed fisheries and increase overall quota uptake. In this scenario, the choke species per fleet are the same as for the ""min"" scenario. Catches for all stocks in 2024 are slightly increased above the ""min"" scenario as a result of the increase in catch opportunity provided by the scaled F<sub>MSY</sub> advice rule (Table 3, Figure 1). </p><p>The ""min_exzero"" scenario is consistent with a full implementation of a landing obligation given the individual single stock advice for all stocks except cod and whiting. In this scenario cod and whiting were not included as effort-restricting stocks. In 2024, haddock becomes the most limiting stock constraining 11 out of 35 fleet segments for this scenario. The remaining fleets are constrained by Norway lobster (eight fleets across three functional units), hake (five fleets), Celtic Sea sole and western English Channel sole (four fleets for each), white anglerfish (two fleets) and megrim (one fleet; Figure 2).</p><p>In addition, a ""had-cs"" scenario is presented because of the strong technical interaction between haddock and the two zero-catch advice cod and whiting stocks. This scenario assumes that effort is set according to the single-stock catch advice for haddock for all fleets (based on ICES MSY approach) and presents catches for other stocks in a mixed-fisheries context. Under this scenario, the haddock catch advice is fully utilized, while the cod and whiting catch advice are exceeded. All other stock catch advice is underutilized (Table 3, Figure 1).</p><p>ICES single-stock advice for demersal stocks considered here is based on its MSY approach, except for Norway lobster outside of FUs, which is based on ICES precautionary approach. ICES provides zero-catch advice for cod and whiting in 2024, based on the MSY approach with precautionary considerations. Scenario results show that it is not possible to achieve all advised single stock catches simultaneously under current fishing patterns. Additionally, there is no scenario which can achieve SSB above Blim for cod or whiting in 2025 (Table 5).</p>","<h4>Catch scenarios</h4>
<p>The ICES single-stock catch advice for demersal stocks in 2023 is based on either existing management plans, ICES MSY approach, or ICES precautionary approach (PA).

MF_4,"<h4><b>Quality considerations</b></h4>
<p>The single-stock assessments form the basis of the mixed-fisheries scenarios, and the single-stock forecasts are reproduced as part of the mixed-fisheries analyses, allowing for additional quality control of both processes. Some discrepancies are to be expected between the single-stock forecasts and the reproduction of the advice in the mixed-fisheries forecast. Despite the methodological differences between single-stock forecasts and mixed-fisheries forecasts, the differences observed this year were small (< 3%) for all stocks, and the mixed-fisheries forecast was considered close enough to the single-stock advice to be used as a basis for the mixed-fisheries scenarios. The quality of the individual forecasts of the single-stocks will affect the quality of the mixed-fisheries scenarios.</p><p>Two new scenarios have been added this year: a ""min_range"" scenario and a ""min_exzero"" scenario (Table 1).</p> 
<h4><b>Issues relevant for the advice</b></h4><p>Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on the central assumptions that fishing patterns of fleets (quota shares per stock, effort allocation to different m&#233tiers) and catchability in 2023 and 2024 are the same as those in recent years (2020-2022). In reality, fishing patterns may change over time, particularly in response to significant changes in policy.</p><p>The model includes four stocks (ank.27.78abd, hke.27.3a46-8abd, mon.27.78abd, and meg.27.7b-k8abd) that are also included in the mixed fisheries advice for the Bay of Biscay ecoregion. Catches of these stocks outside of the Celtic Sea are included in the model as separate fleets, and full uptake of stock shares for these fleets is assumed. The outcomes for ank.27.78abd, hke.27.3a46-8abd, mon.27.78abd, and meg.27.7b-k8abd can only be considered representative in the context of Celtic Sea demersal fisheries. There may be inconsistencies between the catch forecasts in scenarios in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay mixed-fisheries considerations. </p><p>Megrims and anglerfishes are mainly abundant in different locations to cod, haddock, and whiting. This implies that there is potential for fleets to more selectively fish on these groups (Dolder et al., 2018). This flexibility is not captured in the mixed-fisheries forecasts because of the assumption of a static distribution of fishing effort among a given fleet's m&#233tiers.</p><p>Each of the TACs for anglerfish and megrim includes advice for two species (for anglerfish, <em>Lophius piscatorius</em> and <em>L. budegassa</em>; for megrim, <em>Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis</em> and <em>L. boscii</em>). <em>Lepidorhombus boscii</em> (which accounts for < 5% of megrim catches from each area) is not yet included in the mixed fisheries analysis; however, the model includes the majority of the megrim stock catches. </p><p>Norway lobster fisheries are managed under one TAC for Subarea 7, while ICES advises on the basis of FUs. Similarly, anglerfish and megrim are managed with combined-species TACs. The mixed-fisheries analysis is based on ICES catch advice for the individual FUs and stocks. As a consequence, the extent of effort limitation may differ if based on TAC unit rather than on individual FU/stock.</p><p>The present analysis includes nine demersal fish stocks and six Norway lobster stocks. Other species are caught in these fisheries and could influence fishing activity. For Norway lobster, only part of the TAC area (Subarea 7) is covered by this case study, but the TAC is a combination of all FUs of Norway lobster in Subarea 7. This includes a restriction on how much can be taken from FU 16 (a so-called 'of which' provision).</p><p>The ""min_range"" scenario makes use of the multiannual plan (MAP) FMSY ranges defined for demersal stocks under the EU MAP for the western waters (EU, 2019). There is no agreement with UK regarding this plan, and it is not used as the basis of the advice for these shared stocks. </p><p>

<h4><b>Methods and data</b></h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on species composition in catches in the Celtic Seas fisheries (Moore <em>et al.</em>, 2019)); this is done using the FCube method (Ulrich <em>et al.</em>, 2011, 2017). The forecasts are presented in terms of total catches. All stocks have been under a landing obligation since 2019, and all catches for these species are assumed to count against the fleet stock shares each year. Note that the FCube method restricts effort using an F target and therefore may slightly deviate from target catch advice.</p>
<p>Fleets used in the mixed-fisheries analysis are defined by their country, predominant gear type, and vessel length. Fleets landing less than 1% of each stock (2020-2022) are aggregated to the ""MIS_MIS"" fleet. Fleets that have catches but lack corresponding effort data are included in the mixed-fisheries model to account for all sources of fishing mortality for the stocks included. The ""OTH"" fleets (one per stock) account for differences in total catch between the fleet data and observed catches from the single stock assessments. Out-of-area catches for stocks where they occur are also accounted for in the stock-specific fleets. The ""OTH"" and ""MIS_MIS"" fleets are not included in Figure 2.</p><p>Table 6 describes the m&#233tiers used, and Figure 3 illustrates the landings by m&#233tier and stock. M&#233tiers are based on gear type and target assemblage. Within a fleet, m&#233tiers that do not land more than 10% of any stock (2020-2022) are aggregated under the ""MIS"" m&#233tier.</p><p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts include full analytical single-stock assessments for the following stocks: cod, haddock, whiting, megrim, white and black-bellied anglerfish, hake, and sole (in the Celtic Sea and in the western English channel), as well as five Norway lobster FUs with underwater TV (UWTV) surveys for absolute estimates of abundance. There are differences between stock areas, management areas, and management rules (ICES MSY approach or precautionary approach) for the stocks considered here. Table 8 summarizes the advice area and management areas for the main stocks.</p><p>For Norway lobster, only part of the TAC area (Subarea 7) is covered by this case study, although a single TAC covers all Fus of Norway lobster in Subarea 7. As there is a restriction on how much can be taken from FU 16 (a so-called 'of which' provision), this FU is treated separately. First, these landings are assumed to come from FU 16 (full uptake of its 'of which' provision) and then from the rest of Subarea 7. The rest of the Subarea 7 landings are assumed to come from the Celtic Sea (41.3%) and from the Irish Sea (58.7%; average landing proportions 2000-2022).</p>
<p>Average total landings (2020-2022) of all species considered in the mixed-fisheries advice were 92 400 tonnes, with:</p>
<ul><li> 37% landed by otter trawls and seines </li>
<li> 6% by gillnets, trammel nets and pots </li><li> 12% by beam trawls </li>
<li> 8% by longlines </li>
<li> 4% by unknown gears </li><li> 32% by fleets outside the area </li></ul>

<p>Total discards (not shown in Figure 4) were 11 030 tonnes (11% by weight of total catch). </p>

","<h4>Quality considerations</h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries projections for the Celtic Seas ecoregion are based on full analytical single-stock assessments. Single-stock forecasts are also reproduced independently as part of the mixed-fisheries analyses, allowing additional quality control of both processes. Despite the methodological differences between single-stock assessment and mixed-fisheries forecast, the differences observed this year were small (< 6%) for all stocks, and the WGMIXFISH deterministic forecast was considered close enough to the single-stock advice to be used as a basis for the mixed-fisheries projections. The quality of the individual forecasts of the single-stocks will affect the quality of the mixed-fisheries scenarios. For the mixed-fisheries advice, the intermediate year assumption used was <em>status quo</em> fishing effort (average 2019-2021).</p>
<p>In previous years' mixed-fisheries considerations, a ""range"" scenario was presented that attempted to identify F values within the F<sub>MSY</sub> range of each stock that minimized the difference in total catch between the ""min"" and ""max"" scenarios, thus reducing the potential for catch advice overshoot and undershoot. During this years WGMIXFISH ADVICE meeting, it became apparent that the optimisation routine could only derive stable solutions for F values of the most and least limiting stocks - and not for all stocks. In order to avoid misinterpretation, it was decided to remove this scenario from the advice until a more appropriate approach can be developed. </p> 
<h4>Issues relevant for the advice</h4><p>The model includes four stocks (ank.27.78abd, hke.27.3a46-8abd, mon.27.78abd, and meg.27.7b-k8abd) that are also included in the mixed fisheries advice for the Bay of Biscay ecoregion. Catches of these stocks outside of the Celtic Sea are included in the model as separate fleets, and full uptake of stock shares for these fleets is assumed. The outcomes for ank.27.78abd, hke.27.3a46-8abd, mon.27.78abd, and meg.27.7b-k8abd can only be considered representative in the context of Celtic Sea demersal fisheries. There may be inconsistencies between the catch forecasts in scenarios in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay mixed-fisheries advice; in future years, consideration will be given to splitting the presented catch advice between the respective areas. Differences in stock distributions mean that spatial decoupling of catches of cod, haddock, and whiting from those of megrims, anglerfishes, and sole could be achieved (Dolder <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p><p>Norway lobster fisheries are managed on the basis of one TAC for Subarea 7, while ICES advises on the basis of FUs. Similarly, anglerfish and megrim are managed with combined-species TACs. The mixed-fisheries analysis is based on ICES catch advice for the individual FUs and stocks.

<p>Each of the TACs for anglerfish and megrim covers two species (for anglerfish <em>Lophius piscatorius</em> and <em>L. budegassa</em>, for megrim <em>Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis</em> and <em>L. boscii</em>). <em>Lepidorhombus boscii </em> (which accounts for < 5% of megrim catches from each area) is not yet included in the mixed fisheries catch advice; however, the majority of the TACs set for megrim stocks are included. </p>
<p>The results for the whiting scenario are applicable at the stock level.  Catches of the whg.27.7bce-k stock fall under a TAC area that also includes 7d and whiting in 7d are part of the whg.27.47d stock.  This means that, unless the TAC management units are aligned to biological stock areas, there is the potential for catches coming from advice for whg.27.47d to be taken from the whg.27.7bce-k stock.</p>  
<p>For Norway lobster, only part of the TAC area (Subarea 7) is covered by this case study, but a single TAC covers all FUs of Norway lobster in Subarea 7. This includes a restriction on how much can be taken from FU 16 (a so-called 'of which' provision). For the mixed-fisheries projections it was assumed that all the Norway lobster TAC is landed.

The rest of the Subarea 7 landings are assumed to come from the Celtic Sea (41.7%) and from the Irish Sea (58.3%; average landing proportions from 2000 to 2021).</p>
<p>The mixed-fisheries scenarios and forecasts are produced using data requested as part of an ICES data call. This provides consistency in catch and effort totals. Additionally, separate data files containing total weight of landings and effort in kWdays by fleet and metier are requested. Fleet and metier categories used in the mixed-fisheries analysis are based on DCF level 4 and 5 categories, respectively. Grouping across categories has been performed to aggregate over 'small' metiers (defined as fleets with less than 1.0% landed in 2019-2021 for each of the stocks considered; metiers less than 10% landed).</p>

<p>Average total landings (2019-2021) of all species considered in the mixed-fisheries advice were 82 817 tonnes. The breakdown by stock is shown in Figure 4 and percentages by gear are:</p>
<ul><li> 60% landed by otter trawls and seines </li>
<li> 10% by beam trawls </li>
<li> 19% by gillnets, trammelnets and pots </li>
<li> < 1 % by longlines </li>
<li> 11% by unknown gears </li></ul>

<p>Total discards (not shown in Figure 4) were 10 279 tonnes (11% by weight of total catch). </p>

MF_6,"<h4><b>Request</b></h4>
EU DGMARE has asked ICES to evaluate the following:
<em><p>For by-catch and for target stocks (except data-limited deep sea stocks) where ICES is advising zero catch but the stock is caught in mixed fisheries with other species where non-zero catches are advised, and where sufficient data and understanding of processes exist, ICES will provide estimates of the likely catches of stocks for which there is zero catch advice, under the assumption that TACs for the target stocks are set in line with ICES advice, respectively in line with FMSY point and with FMSY lower, where available. In doing so, for the stocks for which there is zero catch advice, ICES will for the likely catches quantify corresponding changes in biomass and the probability of the biomass being above Blim at the end of the projection year.</p>
<p>For stocks where ICES is advising zero catches, ICES will identify stocks for which a sentinel fishery is required to monitor stock development. For such stocks, where possible, ICES will provide the minimum level of catches needed to provide sufficient data for ICES to continue providing scientific advice on the state of the stock. In doing so, ICES should in particular consider the following stocks for which there was advice for zero catches in 2022 and for which a sentinel fishery was conducted in 2023 or was being considered for 2023.  </p></em>

<h4><b>Cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em> in divisions 7.e-k</b></h4>
<p>Cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em>  in divisions 7.e-k is a target species in the EU multiannual management plan (EU MAP; EU, 2019). The zero-catch advice provided by ICES for this stock is based on precautionary considerations. The mixed-fisheries analysis shows that cod is caught in most mixed fisheries in the Celtic Sea with other species for which non-zero catches are advised. This technical service provides illustrative catch scenarios consistent with the lower F<sub>MSY</sub> range for haddock as detailed below.</p>
<p>For cod in divisions 7.e-k:</p>
<ul><li> 799 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at F<sub>MSY</sub> this would result in a cod spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 1024 tonnes in2025;</li>
<li> 571 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at F<sub>MSYlower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 1361 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li> 688 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished midway between F<sub>MSY</sub> and F<sub>MSYlower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 1186 tonnes in 2025;</li>
</ul>
<p>The haddock F<sub>MSY</sub>, haddock F<sub>MSY lower</sub> - F<sub>MSY</sub> and haddock F<sub>MSY lower</sub> scenarios result in an increase in cod SSB relative to 2024 (733 tonnes). All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (4200 tonnes) in 2025.</p>
<p>It is not possible to provide catch scenarios that include changes in the fishing pattern. The above scenarios assume a fixed fishing pattern in 2024 [based on average (2020-2022)]. Future changes in the fishing pattern depend on management measures and the response of the fishery, which cannot be predicted by ICES.</p>
<p>Since cod are taken as bycatch in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p>
<h4><b>Pollack (<em>Pollachius pollachius</em>) in subareas 6-7 (Celtic Seas and the English Channel)</b> </h4>
<p>ICES has provided forecasts on the development of pollack (Pollachius pollachius) in subareas 6-7 (Celtic Seas and the English Channel). There are no catch scenarios that will rebuild the stock above B<sub>lim</sub> by 2025. ICES, therefore, advises zero catch in 2024.</p> 
<p>Pollack is caught in demersal mixed fisheries although there are some fisheries targeting pollack in certain areas. Due to the large geographic range of this stock, regional differences in fishing practices, and the diverse range of species that are caught together with this stock, it is not possible to produce mixed fisheries scenarios for 2024. </p> 
<p>For pollack in subareas 6-7:
<ul><li> If catches are such that stock biomass is stable between 2024 and 2025, it would result in a catch of 1363 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> If catches are such that stock biomass increases by +10% between 2024 and 2025, it would result in a catch of 1145 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> If catches are such that stock biomass increases by +20% between 2024 and 2025, it would result in a catch of 925 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> If catches are such that stock biomass increases by +30% between 2024 and 2025, it would result in a catch of 705 tonnes in 2024.</li>
</ul></p> 
<p>Pollack in subareas 6-7 is subject to a multiannual management plan (MAP), but F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges are not available. Options are provided to increase the stock biomass.</p> 
<p>Since pollack are taken as bycatch in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC is not required for this stock.</p> 

<h4><b>Whiting (<em>Merlangius merlangus</em>) in divisions 7.b-c and e-k</b></h4> <p>Whiting (<em>Merlangius merlangus</em>) in divisions 7.b-c and e-k is a target species in the EU multiannual management plan (EU MAP; EU, 2019). The zero-catch advice provided by ICES for this stock is based on precautionary considerations. The mixed fisheries analysis shows that whiting is caught in most mixed fisheries in the Celtic Sea with other species for which non-zero catches are advised. The present technical service provides illustrative catch scenarios consistent with the lower F<sub>MSY</sub> range for haddock as detailed below.</p>
<p>For whiting in divisions 7.b-c and e-k:
<ul><li> 8033 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at FMSY; this would result in a whiting spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 26 336 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li> 5545 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at FMSY lower; this would result in a whiting SSB of 28 520 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li> 6803 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished midway between FMSY and FMSY lower; this would result in a whiting SSB of 27 412 tonnes in 2025;</li>
</ul></p> 
<p>The haddock F<sub>MSY lower</sub> - F<sub>MSY</sub>, and haddock F<sub>MSY lower</sub> scenarios result in an increase in whiting SSB relative to 2024 (26 361 tonnes), while the haddock F<sub>MSY</sub> scenario results in an almost unchanged SSB. All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (36 571 tonnes) in 2025.</p> 
<p>It is not possible to provide catch scenarios that include changes in the fishing pattern. The above scenarios assume a fixed fishing pattern in 2024 [based on average (2020-2022)]. Future changes in the fishing pattern depend on management measures and the response of the fishery, neither of which can be predicted by ICES.</p> 
<p>Since whiting are caught as bycatch in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p> 

<h4><b>Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>) in divisions 7.a South of 52&deg30'N, 7.g-h, and 7.j-k (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and southwest of Ireland)</b></h4>
<p>ICES has provided forecasts on the development of herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>) in divisions 7.a South of 52&deg30'N, 7.g-h, and 7.j-k (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and southwest of Ireland). All scenarios assumed full uptake of the monitoring TAC in the intermediate year (2023). There are no catch scenarios that will rebuild the stock above B<sub>lim</sub> by 2025. ICES, therefore, advises zero catch in 2024. ICES has also provided a catch scenario consistent with the monitoring TAC (869 tonnes [t]) in the single stock advice sheet (ICES, 2019).</p> 


","<h3>Request</h3>
EU DGMARE has asked ICES to evaluate the following:
<em><p>For by-catch and for target stocks where ICES is advising zero TACs, but the stock is caught in demersal mixed-fisheries with other species where non-zero catches are advised, where possible ICES will provide the EU with illustrative catch scenarios that are consistent with the advice for the main target species in the fishery. This may involve carrying out mixed fisheries forecast or providing F-multipliers consistent with the advice for the target stocks or where forecasts are not possible the catch scenario should be based the best available scientific information.</p>
<p>Where the zero TAC advice is given for a target stock subject to a MAP the catch scenarios for the zero TAC stock should include scenarios consistent the F<sub>MSY</sub> range in the target stock (e.g., F<sub>MSY</sub>, F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> and intermediate values) and quantify the corresponding changes in biomass. Where possible, F scenarios that give, a stable biomass and increasing biomass (if F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges do not) should also be provided. </p>
<p>Where possible ICES should provide catch scenarios which include changes in fishing pattern if they considered likely by ICES.</p>

<p>For cod in divisions 7.e-k:</p>
<ul><li> 1002 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at F<sub>MSY</sub> this would result in a cod spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 1261 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> 717 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 1671 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> 869 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished midway between F<sub>MSY</sub> and F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 1450 tonnes in 2024;</li>
</ul>
<p>The haddock F<sub>MSY</sub>, haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> - F<sub>MSY</sub> and haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> scenarios result in an increase in cod SSB relative to 2023 (1053 tonnes). All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (4200 tonnes) in 2024.</p>
<p>It is not possible to provide catch scenarios that include changes in the fishing pattern. The above scenarios assume a fixed fishing pattern in 2023 [based on average (2019-2021)]. Future changes in the fishing pattern depend on management measures and the response of the fishery, which cannot be predicted by ICES.</p>
<p>Since cod are bycaught in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p>
<h4>Cod in Division 6.a, Cod in Division 7.a and whiting in Division 7.a </h4>
<p>ICES has provided estimates of the likely catches of several stocks under the assumption that TACs for the target stocks are set in line with ICES advice.</p>
<ul><li> For cod in Division 6.a, catches in 2023 are estimated to be between 1642 tonnes and 2562 tonnes, assuming fishing mortality on cod does not change or increases by the same proportion as the change advised for haddock.

<li>For cod in Division 7.a, catches in 2023 are estimated to be around 159 tonnes, assuming that the fishing mortality on cod changes by the same proportion as the changes advised for haddock and <em>Nephrops</em> fleets and that the fleets operate in a similar way as in the past 3 years. Under this scenario spawning-stock biomass (SSB) in 2024 is expected to increase by 6.4% from 2023 to 2024.</li><li> For whiting in Division 7.a, forecasted bycatch levels in 2023 are 1125 tonnes, using a model of whiting bycatch in the <em>Nephrops</em> fishery and assuming 8476 tonnes of <em>Nephrops</em> catches in 2023. This is expected to result in a 1% increase in 2023.</li></ul>

FisheriesOverview,,"<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2023</h3>

<p>The ICES Fisheries Overview provides and overview of fisheries in the broader Celtic Sea Ecoregion.  This advice provides a summary of who is fishing, trends in catches over time, descriptions of fisheries, summary of management, the status of fisheries resources, mixed fisheries and multi-species interactions, effects of fisheries on the ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The commercial fisheries in the Celtic Sea target a large number of stocks. The pelagic fisheries, which account for the largest catches (by weight) in the region are the mid-water trawl fisheries for blue whiting, mackerel, horse mackerel, herring, boarfish, and sprat. The largest demersal fishery targets hake along the shelf edge using gillnets and longlines. There are also large mixed bottom-trawl fisheries targeting benthic species, Norway lobster, and gadoids. The species composition of these mixed fisheries tends to vary, depending on the area and the countries involved in the fishery.</p>
<p>The relationship of biomass status or the fishing mortality to reference points is not known for 60% of the 107 stocks that are assessed in the ecoregion. Though only 31% of the stocks are fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>, these stocks account for nearly 44% of the total landings. There has been a trend of declining fishing mortality since the mid-1990s for the benthic and demersal stocks with known status. The average F/F<sub>MSY</sub> ratio is below 1 for assessed benthic stocks and just above for the assessed demersal stocks. The trend for stock size in assessed benthic and demersal stocks has been increasing over the same period. The average F/F<sub>MSY</sub> ratio is below 1 for the crustacean stocks and the average biomass has been above 1 in the past decade. The average F/F<sub>MSY</sub> ratio for pelagic assessed stocks has been above 1 in recent years, and the average stock size indicator is declining in recent years but remains above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. </p>
<p>Technical interactions in demersal mixed fisheries are described for three areas within the ecoregion. Norway lobster account for the highest landings in the Irish Sea; they are mainly taken in trawl fisheries where they account for more than 90% of the total landings. In the Celtic Sea and west of Ireland hake account for the majority of the landings; they are mainly taken in longline and gillnet fisheries which are also dominated by hake. In the west of Scotland Norway lobster again account for the highest landings; they are mainly taken using otter trawls, but also in pots.</p>

In the Celtic Sea and west of Ireland hake account for the majority of the landings; they are mainly taken in longline and gillnet fisheries which are also dominated by hake. In the west of Scotland Norway lobster again account for the highest landings; they are mainly taken using otter trawls, but also in pots.</p>

IrishSea,"<h3>IRISH SEA MIXED FISHERIES ADVICE</h3><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><h4><b>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2024</b></h4>
<p><strong>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice to inform the management of demersal fisheries in the Irish Sea.  Mixed-fisheries considerations combine single-species stock assessments with information on the average catch composition and fishing effort of the fleets catching cod, haddock, whiting, Norway lobster, plaice, and sole in the Irish Sea.  Almost all fleets in the Irish Sea catch cod and whiting which are the most limiting stocks in this area. The 2024 zero catch advised by ICES for cod and whiting at implies that catches of the other stocks would also be zero.</p>
<p>ICES provide a number of illustrative scenarios. For example, the status quo effort is analogous to business as usual.  Under this scenario there would be significant catches of cod and whiting above the single stock advice leading to further depletion of those stocks.</strong> </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Fisheries in the Irish Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a variety of different gears. Therefore, in line with the operational nature of the fishery, ICES produces mixed-fisheries scenarios for the Celtic Sea. The advice highlights the potential implications of single stock management on the catches of multiple stocks caught together in mixed-fisheries. </p>
<p>Past fishing patterns, catchability of fleets and single species TAC advice are used to produce a quantitative forecast of over- and under- exploitation of the different stocks given their mixed fishery interactions. Forecasts are summarised in a range of potential management scenarios. </p>
<p>The full mixed fisheries advice for Irish Sea mixed fisheries consideration is published here:</p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.24212106 "" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.24212106 </a></p>

<h4><b>Mixed-fisheries considerations</b> </h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are presented for cod (cod.27.7a), haddock (had.27.7a), plaice (ple.27.7a), sole (sol.27.7a), whiting (whg.27.7a), and Norway lobster (functional units [FUs] 14 and 15; nep.fu.14; nep.fu.15) in the IrishSea.</p>
<p>Given the single-stock catch advice for 2024, the most limiting stocks for demersal fisheries in the Irish Sea are whiting, with all 12 defined fleets reaching their whiting quota with a lower effort than for the other stocks, and sole and cod, with 11 of 12 defined fleets reaching their quotas with a lower effort than for the other stocks. The least limiting stock is plaice (11 of 12 fleets). It is assumed that fleet fishing patterns in the forecast years are the same as observed in the recent past.</p><p>Mixed fisheries projections are conducted for nine scenarios corresponding to different assumptions on the future effort deployment by the fleets (Table 1). The trade-offs in catches and any potential for overshoot and undershoot of the single-stock advice associated with each scenario are shown (Figure 1).</p>
",,
IS_3,"<h4><b>Catch scenarios</b></h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries analyses consider the implications of mixed fisheries operating under single-stock catch advice regimes given that there are no changes in the quota shares of the fleets for the different stocks, in the proportion of effort per m&#233tiers for each fleet, in discard rates or catchability in the m&#233tiers during the forecast period compared to the most recent data years (2020-2022). Scenario assumptions for the intermediate year (2023) and forecast year (2024) are listed in Table 2. These assumptions may differ from those used in the single stock forecasts.</p><p>A total of nine scenarios are presented, corresponding to different effort constraints for 2024 (Table 1). The forecasted scenarios are presented in terms of catch and the potential for catch advice over - and undershoot, which is driven by the most and the least restrictive single-stock advice (Table 3; Figure 1). Scenario results for fishing mortality (F) in 2024 and spawning stock biomass (SSB) in 2025 are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.</p><p>Scenarios that result in under - or overshoot are useful in identifying the main mismatches between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks, where limiting catch advice can create potential ""choke species"" effects at fleet level. They indicate the direction in which fleets may have to adapt their fishing behaviour to more fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. Estimates of effort required by each fleet segment to reach its ""share"" of each single-stock advice are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>The ""min"" scenario is consistent with a full implementation of a landing obligation (without any exemptions) given the individual single stock advice (Table 3, Figure 1). In 2024, the ""min"" scenario shows that whiting limits all 12 fleets. This is due to the zero catch advice for whiting and that all fleets catch whiting. Secondarily, cod and sole are also very limiting due to the zero-catch advice for these stocks. Cod and sole are caught by 11 of the 12 fleets (Figure 2).</p><p>The ""max"" scenario shows the upper bound of potential fleet effort and stock catches (Table 3, Figure 1) in that it assumes all fleets continue fishing until all their stock shares for all stocks are exhausted irrespective of economic viability, legality, or fleet capacity. In 2024, the ""max"" scenario, shows that plaice would be the least limiting stock for 11 out of 12 fleets (Figure 2).</p><p>The status quo effort ""sq_E"" scenario sets the effort of each fleet in the forecast years equal to the average of the effort in the most recent three years for which data are available (2020 - 2022). This scenario investigates the mixed fisheries outcomes if the situation remains the same in terms of total effort and effort allocation among m&#233tiers. For 2024, this scenario shows advised catch overshoots for cod and whiting and undershoots of haddock and Norway lobster (Table 3, Figure 1).</p><p>The ""min_range"" scenario explores how the higher catch options associated with the F<sub>MSY upper</sub> or scaled F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points (for stocks where ranges are defined) may reduce choking behaviour in mixed fisheries and increase overall quota uptake. Catches for all stocks in 2024 are marginally increased above the ""min"" scenario because of the increase in catch opportunity provided by the scaled F<sub>MSY</sub> advice rule (Table 3, Figure 1). </p><p>In addition, several stock-specific scenarios are presented to further explore the consequences of individual stock catch advice on the catches of other stocks. In all stock-specific scenarios, fleets which target sole (all beam trawls and Belgian otter trawls) are assumed to be restricted by the zero-catch advice for sole in 2024 rather than the scenario-specified stock. Therefore, the sole and plaice results for catches, F, and SSB under these scenarios should be interpreted as resulting from the likely bycatch of those stocks only by fleets which do not primarily target sole (for details see 'Quality considerations' below; ICES, 2023a). </p><p>
The ""nep-is"" scenario results in an overshoot for cod, sole, and whiting and an undershoot for haddock and plaice. The ""had-is"" scenario would result in an overshoot of the catch advice for other stocks, except plaice. Catches in both the ""nep-is"" and ""had-is"" advice scenarios are considerably above those of the ""sq_E"" scenario, indicating that the fishing effort required to achieve the 2024 catch advice for Norway lobster and haddock is higher than that observed in recent years (Table 3, Figure 1). </p><p>
The ""cod-is"", ""sol-is"", and ""whg-is"" scenarios are presented to explore the consequences of the zero catch advice for these stocks. The ""whg-is""  scenario implies that catches of the other Irish Sea stocks would also be zero (equal to the ""min"" scenario). However, the ""cod-is"" and ""sol-is"" scenarios suggest that there would be some small catches of whiting by a single fleet which is not restricted by the zero catch advice for these two stocks (Figure 2). </p><p>
ICES single-stock catch advice for demersal stocks in 2024 is based on ICES MSY approach, with precautionary considerations where appropriate (Table 8). Scenario results show that it is not possible to achieve all advised single stock catches simultaneously under current fishing patterns. Additionally, there is no scenario which can achieve SSB above B<sub>lim</sub> for whiting in 2025 (Table 5).</p>

",,
IS_4,"<h4><b>Quality considerations</b></h4>
<p>The single-stock assessments form the basis of the mixed-fisheries scenarios, and the single-stock forecasts are reproduced as part of the mixed-fisheries analyses allowing for additional quality control of both processes. Some discrepancies are to be expected between the single-stock forecasts and the reproduction of the advice in the mixed-fisheries forecast. Despite the methodological differences between single-stock forecasts and mixed-fisheries forecasts, the differences observed this year were small (< 4%) for all stocks, and the mixed-fisheries forecast was considered close enough to the single-stock advice to be used as a basis for the mixed-fisheries scenarios. The quality of the individual forecasts of the single stocks will affect the quality of the mixed-fisheries scenarios.</p><p>A retrospective analysis highlighted difficulties in predicting catches of sole based on Norway lobster and gadoid catches under previous model assumptions (ICES, 2023a). This is due to differences in the fleet behaviour of fleets predominantly targeting sole (beam trawl fleets and Belgian otter trawls), which are largely unrelated to other fisheries in the region. Therefore, this year, the stock-specific scenarios (Table 1) additionally restrict the effort of fleets targeting sole in the region, based on the zero-catch advice for sole in 2024. This affects the interpretation of these scenarios, particularly for Norway lobster and haddock (""nep-is"" and ""had-is""), where projected catch, F, and SSB (including those of sole and plaice) do not include any contribution from these fleets.</p><p>At present there is not sufficient spatially disaggregated data to characterize the catches of fleets within the two Irish Sea FUs separately; therefore, they are combined into a single catch scenario for the Norway lobster in the Irish Sea.</p><p>A new ""min_range"" scenario has been added this year (see Table 1).</p> 
<h4><b>Issues relevant for the advice</b></h4><p>Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on the central assumptions that fishing patterns of fleets (quota shares per stock, effort allocation to different m&#233tiers) and catchability in 2023 and 2024 are the same as those in recent years (2020-2022). In reality, fishing patterns may change over time, particularly in response to significant changes in policy.</p><p>The current mixed-fisheries scenarios illustrate the implications of the single-species advice for cod, haddock, Norway lobster, plaice, sole, and whiting stocks. Additional scenarios for zero catch advice stocks (cod, sole, and whiting) are provided in ICES (2023d, 2023e, 2023f).</p><p>Norway lobster fisheries are managed under a single TAC for Subarea 7 (including seven FUs), while ICES single stock advice is on the basis of individual FUs. The Irish Sea mixed-fisheries analysis considers FUs within Division 7a only (FUs 14 and 15). As a consequence, the extent of effort limitation may differ from that of the full TAC area. </p><p>
The present analysis includes five demersal fish stocks and two Norway lobster stocks. Other species are caught in these fisheries and could influence fishing activity.</p><p>
The ""min_range"" scenario makes use of the multiannual plan (MAP) F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges defined for demersal stocks under the EU MAP for the western waters (EU, 2019). There is no agreement with UK regarding this plan, and it is not used as the basis of the advice for these shared stocks. </p><p>

<h4><b>Methods and data</b></h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on single-stock assessments combined with fishing effort and catches using the FCube method (Ulrich <em>et al.</em>, 2011, 2017). The projections are presented in terms of total catches. All stocks have been under a landing obligation since 2019, and all catches for these species are assumed to count against the fleet stock shares each year. Note that the FCube method restricts effort using an F target and therefore may slightly deviate from target catch advice (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Fleets used in the mixed-fisheries analysis are defined by their country, predominant gear type. Fleets landing less than 1% of each stock (2020-2022) are aggregated to the ""MIS_MIS"" fleet. </p><p>M&#233tiers are based on gear type and target assemblage. Within a fleet, m&#233tiers landing less than 1% of each stock (2020-2022) are aggregated under the ""MIS"" m&#233tier category.</p><p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts include full analytical single-stock assessments for the following demersal fish stocks: cod, haddock, plaice, sole, and whiting, as well as a combined Irish Sea Norway lobster stock consisting of Norway lobster FUs 14-15 with underwater TV (UWTV) surveys for absolute estimates of abundance. There are differences between stock areas, management areas, and management rules for the stocks considered here. Table 8 summarizes the advice area and management areas for each stock.</p>
<p>Average total landings (2020-2022, Figure 4) of all species considered in the mixed-fisheries advice were 8 922 tonnes, with:
<ul><li> 79%  by otter trawls targeting crustaceans; </li>
<li> 11% by otter trawls targeting demersal fish; </li>
<li> 8% by beam trawls; </li>
<li> 1% by other gears.</li></ul></p>

<p>Total discards (not shown in Figure 4) were 3 124 tonnes (26% by weight of total catch). </p>

IS_6,"<h4><b>Request</b></h4>
EU DGMARE has asked ICES to evaluate the following:
<em><p>For by-catch and for target stocks (except data-limited deep sea stocks) where ICES is advising zero catch but the stock is caught in mixed fisheries with other species where non-zero catches are advised, and where sufficient data and understanding of processes exist, ICES will provide estimates of the likely catches of stocks for which there is zero catch advice, under the assumption that TACs for the target stocks are set in line with ICES advice, respectively in line with F<sub>MSY</sub> point and with F<sub>MSY lower</sub>, where available. In doing so, for the stocks for which there is zero catch advice, ICES will for the likely catches quantify corresponding changes in biomass and the probability of the biomass being above B<sub>lim</sub> at the end of the projection year.</p>
<p>For stocks where ICES is advising zero catches, ICES will identify stocks for which a sentinel fishery is required to monitor stock development. For such stocks, where possible, ICES will provide the minimum level of catches needed to provide sufficient data for ICES to continue providing scientific advice on the state of the stock. In doing so, ICES should in particular consider the following stocks for which there was advice for zero catches in 2022 and for which a sentinel fishery was conducted in 2023 or was being considered for 2023.  </p></em>

<h4><b>Cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em> in divisions 7.a</b></h4>
<p>Cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em>  in divisions 7.a is caught as bycatch, with no targeted fisheries for this stock permitted in this division. The current ICES advice is that when the MSY approach is applied with precautionary considerations, there should be zero catch in the year 2024. The mixed-fisheries analysis shows that cod is primarily caught as a bycatch stock by demersal otter trawl fleets targeting haddock and Norway lobster, and to a lesser degree by other midwater and beam trawl fleets. The EU multiannual plan (MAP) for stocks in Western Waters and adjacent waters (EU, 2019) takes into account bycatch of this species. There is no agreed shared management plan between the EU and UK for this stock.</p><p>This technical service provides two illustrative catch scenarios: one based on the expected bycatch of status quo fishing effort by all fleets and a second based on a rollover of the current cod TAC. </p><p>
<p>For cod in Division 7.a:</p>
<ul><li> 194 tonnes are estimated to be caught as bycatch if fishing effort continue at <em> status quo</em> levels (average 2020-2022); this would result in a cod spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 10 424 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li> If catches of cod were set according to last year's TAC (165 tonnes); this would result in a cod SSB of 10 456 tonnes in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  <em> status quo</em fishing effort and the TAC<sub>2023</sub> scenarios both result in similar reductions in SSB in 2025 relative to 2024 ( -11.8% and  -11.5%, respectively). Both scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>trigger</sub> (13 012 tonnes) and above B<sub>lim</sub> (9 364 tonnes) in 2025. ICES notes, however, that the SSB forecasts for this stock are highly uncertain and mainly dependent on the estimation of a single recent cohort (ICES, 2023a). </p><p>
<p>Since cod is caught as bycatch in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p>
<h4><b>Whiting (<em>Merlangius merlangus</em>) in divisions 7.a</b></h4> <p>Whiting (<em>Merlangius merlangus</em>) 7.a is taken as bycatch, with no targeted fisheries for this stock permitted. The current ICES advice is that when the MSY approach is applied with precautionary considerations, there should be zero catch in each of the years 2024 and 2025 (ICES, 2023a). The mixed-fisheries analysis shows that whiting is caught as a bycatch species by both demersal and, to a lesser degree, pelagic fisheries in the Irish Sea. The EU multiannual plan (MAP) for stocks in Western Waters and adjacent waters (EU, 2019) takes into account the bycatch of this species. There is no agreed shared management plan between the EU and UK for this stock.</p><p>
This technical service provides four illustrative catch scenarios: one based on expected bycatch of status quo fishing effort, a second based on a rollover of the current TAC, and two further options based on fishing pressures predicted to maintain stable whiting SSB or increase whiting SSB by 20% between 2024 and 2025.</p><p>

<p>For whiting in divisions 7.a
<ul><li>1318 tonnes are estimated to be caught as bycatch if fishing effort continues at status quo levels (average 2020 - 2022), it would result in a whiting spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 982 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li>If catches of whiting in 2024 were set according to last year's TAC (721 tonnes), it would result in a whiting SSB of 1464 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li>If catches of whiting are such that whiting SSB is stable between 2024 and 2025 (1193 tonnes); this would result in a whiting SSB of 1079 tonnes in 2025;</li>
<li>If catches of whiting are such that whiting SSB increases by +20% between 2024 and 2025 (920 tonnes); this would result in a whiting SSB of 1298 tonnes in 2025.</li>
</ul></p> 
The <em>status quo</em> effort scenario results in a reduction in whiting SSB in 2025 relative to 2024  -10%). The rollover whiting TAC scenario would result in an increase in whiting SSB in 2025 relative to 2024 (+34%) if it were successfully implemented. All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (10 000 tonnes) in 2025. <p>
<p>Since whiting are caught as bycatch in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC is not required for this stock.</p> 

<h4><b>Sole (<em>Solea solea</em>) in Division 7.a (Irish Sea) </b></h4>
<p>The current ICES advice is that when the MSY approach and precautionary considerations are applied, there should be zero catch in 2024. Sole (<em>Solea solea</em>) in Division 7.a (sol.27.7a) is a target species in the Irish Sea. Sole is primarily caught by beam trawl fleets, with a minority of catches occurring as bycatch in other fisheries. </p> <p>
The present technical service provides three catch scenarios with a spawning-stock biomass (SSB) target (presented in Table 2) and two illustrative mixed fisheries catch scenarios are discussed (presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5). The SSB target scenarios are: 
<ul><li> a catch option of 203 tonnes is estimated if the SSB is assumed to be equal to B<sub>lim</sub> in 2025;</li>
<li> a catch option of 385 tonnes is estimated if the SSB is assumed to remain stable between 2024 and 2025, resulting in an SSB in 2025 (2340 tonnes) below B<sub>lim</sub> (2500 tonnes);</li>
<li> a catch option of 118 tonnes is estimated if the SSB is assumed to increase by 10% between 2024 and 2025, resulting in an SSB in 2025 (2597 tonnes) just above B<sub>lim</sub>
</ul></p> 
<p>ICES notes that the forecasts for this stock have tended to overestimate SSB in recent years, which implies that the forecasted SSB in 2025 is likely to be overestimated (ICES, 2023a).</p>
