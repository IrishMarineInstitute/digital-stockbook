Mixed Fisheries,"<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2023</h3>
<p>FEAS recognises the potential value of mixed fisheries advice to inform the management of demersal fisheries in the Celtic Sea.  Mixed-fisheries considerations combine single-species stock assessments with information on the average catch composition and fishing effort of the fleets catching cod, haddock, whiting, Norway lobster, sole, white anglerfish, and megrim in the Celtic Sea.  All fleets in the Celtic Sea catch cod, and cod is the most limiting stock in this area. The 2023 forecast with the cod catch advice at zero implies that catches of the other stocks would also be zero.</p>
<p>ICES provide a number of illustrative scenarios. For example, the status quo effort is analogous to business as usual.  Under this scenario there would be significant catches of cod and whiting above the single stock advice leading to further depletion of those stocks. </p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Fisheries in the Celtic Sea are highly mixed, targeting a range of commercial and non-commercial species, with a variety of different gears. Therefore, in line with the operational nature of the fishery, ICES produces mixed-fisheries scenarios for the Celtic Sea. The advice highlights the potential implications of single stock management on the catches of multiple stocks caught together in mixed-fisheries. </p>
<p>Past fishing patterns, catchability of fleets and single species TAC advice are used to produce a quantitative forecast of over- and under- exploitation of the different stocks given their mixed fishery interactions. Forecasts are summarised in a range of potential management scenarios. </p>

<h4>Mixed-fisheries considerations </h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are presented for cod (cod.27.7e-k), haddock (had.27.7b-k), whiting (whg.27.7b-ce-k), Norway lobster (functional units [FUs] 16, 17, 19, 20-21, 22, and 27.7 outside FUs), sole (sol.27.7e and sol.27.7fg), white and black-bellied anglerfish (mon.27.78abd and ank.27.78abd), megrim (meg.27.7b-k8abd) and hake (hke.27.3a46-8abd) in the Celtic Sea.</p>

This is due to the zero catch advice for cod and because almost all fisheries operating with demersal gears catch cod. </p><p>Six fishing scenarios are presented (Figure 1, descriptions in Table 1). These scenarios illustrate trade-offs in catches, fishing mortality and SSB for different mixed fisheries scenarios.</p>

"
MF_3,"<h4>Catch scenarios</h4>
<p>The ICES single-stock catch advice for demersal stocks in 2023 is based on either existing management plans, ICES MSY approach, or ICES precautionary approach (PA). Scenario assumptions for the intermediate year (2022) and forecast year (2023) are listed in Table 2. These assumptions may differ from those used in the single stock forecasts.</p><p>A total of six scenarios are presented, corresponding to different fleet behaviours for 2023 (Table 1). The forecasted scenarios are presented in terms of catch and the potential for quota over - and undershoot, which is driven by the most and the least restrictive single-stock advice (Figure 1). Scenarios that result in under - overutilization are useful in identifying imbalance between the fishing opportunities of the various stocks. They indicate the direction in which fleets may have to adapt to more fully utilize their catch opportunities without collectively exceeding single-stock fishing opportunities. The scenarios presented here assume there are no changes in targeting behaviour, quota shares or selection pattern of the fleets during the forecast period. Estimates of effort required by each fleet segment needed to reach their ""share"" of each single-stock advice are shown in figure 2.</p><p>The ""min"" scenario is consistent with a full implementation of a landing obligation given the individual single stock advice. In 2023, the ""min"" scenario shows that cod limits 29 of the 32 fleets due to the zero catch advice for cod and that almost all fleets catch cod to a greater or lesser extent. The three remaining fleets had no cod landings, with the remaining fleets limited by haddock, hake, and white anglerfish respectively (Figure 2). The ""max"" scenario shows the upper bound of potential fleet effort and stock catches (Table 3, Figure 1) in that it assumes all fleets continue fishing until all their stock shares for all stocks are exhausted irrespective of economic viability, legality, or fleet capacity. In 2023, the ""max"" scenario indicated that fleets have different least limiting stocks, which results in over-quota catches of all stocks (Figure 2). Black bellied anglerfish (23 fleets), hake (three fleets), white anglerfish (one fleet), Norway lobster (three fleets over two different functional units [FUs]), and western English Channel sole (two fleets) are the least limiting stocks.</p><p>Almost all fleets in the Celtic Sea catch cod, which is the most limiting stock in this area. The 2023 forecast with the cod catch advice at zero implies that catches of the other Celtic Sea stocks would also be zero (the ""min"" and ""cod-cs"" scenarios), though there would be some catch of anglerfish, megrim, and hake outside of the Celtic Sea as well as for three fleets without reported cod catches.</p><p>The status quo effort scenario (""sq_E"") results in a small overshoot of haddock, a large overshoot of cod and whiting, and a small undershoot of white and black-bellied anglerfish, hake, megrim, and Norway lobster.</p><p>Mixed-fisheries catch scenario results show that it is not possible to achieve all advised single stock catches simultaneously under the current fishing patterns. ICES single-stock advice for demersal stocks considered here is based on its MSY approach, except for nep.27.7outFU, which is based on the precautionary approach.

MF_4,"<h4>Quality considerations</h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries projections for the Celtic Seas ecoregion are based on full analytical single-stock assessments. Single-stock forecasts are also reproduced independently as part of the mixed-fisheries analyses, allowing additional quality control of both processes. Despite the methodological differences between single-stock assessment and mixed-fisheries forecast, the differences observed this year were small (< 6%) for all stocks, and the WGMIXFISH deterministic forecast was considered close enough to the single-stock advice to be used as a basis for the mixed-fisheries projections. The quality of the individual forecasts of the single-stocks will affect the quality of the mixed-fisheries scenarios. For the mixed-fisheries advice, the intermediate year assumption used was <em>status quo</em> fishing effort (average 2019-2021).</p>
<p>In previous years' mixed-fisheries considerations, a ""range"" scenario was presented that attempted to identify F values within the F<sub>MSY</sub> range of each stock that minimized the difference in total catch between the ""min"" and ""max"" scenarios, thus reducing the potential for catch advice overshoot and undershoot. During this year's WGMIXFISH ADVICE meeting, it became apparent that the optimisation routine could only derive stable solutions for F values of the most and least limiting stocks - and not for all stocks. In order to avoid misinterpretation, it was decided to remove this scenario from the advice until a more appropriate approach can be developed. </p> 
<h4>Issues relevant for the advice</h4><p>The model includes four stocks (ank.27.78abd, hke.27.3a46-8abd, mon.27.78abd, and meg.27.7b-k8abd) that are also included in the mixed fisheries advice for the Bay of Biscay ecoregion. Catches of these stocks outside of the Celtic Sea are included in the model as separate fleets, and full uptake of stock shares for these fleets is assumed. The outcomes for ank.27.78abd, hke.27.3a46-8abd, mon.27.78abd, and meg.27.7b-k8abd can only be considered representative in the context of Celtic Sea demersal fisheries. There may be inconsistencies between the catch forecasts in scenarios in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay mixed-fisheries advice; in future years, consideration will be given to splitting the presented catch advice between the respective areas. Differences in stock distributions mean that spatial decoupling of catches of cod, haddock, and whiting from those of megrims, anglerfishes, and sole could be achieved (Dolder <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p><p>Norway lobster fisheries are managed on the basis of one TAC for Subarea 7, while ICES advises on the basis of FUs. Similarly, anglerfish and megrim are managed with combined-species TACs. The mixed-fisheries analysis is based on ICES catch advice for the individual FUs and stocks. As a consequence, the extent of effort limitation may differ if based on TAC unit rather than on individual FU/stock. </p><p>The present analysis includes nine demersal fish stocks and six Norway lobster stocks. Other species are caught in these fisheries and could influence fishing activity. </p>
<h4>Methods and data</h4>
<p>Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on species composition in catches in the Celtic Seas fisheries (Moore <em>et al.</em>, 2019) and using the FCube method (Ulrich <em>et al.</em>, 2011, 2017). Mixed fisheries scenarios are based on central assumptions that fishing patterns and catchability in the TAC year are the same as those in recent years (2019-2021).</p>
<p>The mixed-fisheries forecasts include full analytical single-stock assessments for the following stocks: cod, haddock, whiting, megrim, white and black-bellied anglerfish, hake, and sole (in two areas); as well as five Norway lobster FUs with underwater TV (UWTV) surveys for absolute estimates of abundance (Table 8).</p>
<p>Each of the TACs for anglerfish and megrim covers two species (for anglerfish <em>Lophius piscatorius</em> and <em>L. budegassa</em>, for megrim <em>Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis</em> and <em>L. boscii</em>). <em>Lepidorhombus boscii </em> (which accounts for < 5% of megrim catches from each area) is not yet included in the mixed fisheries catch advice; however, the majority of the TACs set for megrim stocks are included. </p>
<p>The results for the whiting scenario are applicable at the stock level.  Catches of the whg.27.7bce-k stock fall under a TAC area that also includes 7d and whiting in 7d are part of the whg.27.47d stock.  This means that, unless the TAC management units are aligned to biological stock areas, there is the potential for catches coming from advice for whg.27.47d to be taken from the whg.27.7bce-k stock.</p>  
<p>For Norway lobster, only part of the TAC area (Subarea 7) is covered by this case study, but a single TAC covers all FUs of Norway lobster in Subarea 7. This includes a restriction on how much can be taken from FU 16 (a so-called 'of which' provision). For the mixed-fisheries projections it was assumed that all the Norway lobster TAC is landed. These landings are assumed to come from FU 16 (full uptake of its 'of which' provision) and from the rest of the Subarea 7. The rest of the Subarea 7 landings are assumed to come from the Celtic Sea (41.7%) and from the Irish Sea (58.3%; average landing proportions from 2000 to 2021).</p>
<p>The mixed-fisheries scenarios and forecasts are produced using data requested as part of an ICES data call. This provides consistency in catch and effort totals. Additionally, separate data files containing total weight of landings and effort in kWdays by fleet and metier are requested. Fleet and metier categories used in the mixed-fisheries analysis are based on DCF level 4 and 5 categories, respectively. Grouping across categories has been performed to aggregate over 'small' metiers (defined as fleets with less than 1.0% landed in 2019-2021 for each of the stocks considered; metiers less than 10% landed).</p>

<p>Average total landings (2019-2021) of all species considered in the mixed-fisheries advice were 82 817 tonnes. The breakdown by stock is shown in Figure 4 and percentages by gear are:</p>
<ul><li> 60% landed by otter trawls and seines </li>
<li> 10% by beam trawls </li>
<li> 19% by gillnets, trammelnets and pots </li>
<li> < 1 % by longlines </li>
<li> 11% by unknown gears </li></ul>

<p>Total discards (not shown in Figure 4) were 10 279 tonnes (11% by weight of total catch). </p>

MF_6,"<h3>Request</h3>
EU DGMARE has asked ICES to evaluate the following:
<em><p>For by-catch and for target stocks where ICES is advising zero TACs, but the stock is caught in demersal mixed-fisheries with other species where non-zero catches are advised, where possible ICES will provide the EU with illustrative catch scenarios that are consistent with the advice for the main target species in the fishery. This may involve carrying out mixed fisheries forecast or providing F-multipliers consistent with the advice for the target stocks or where forecasts are not possible the catch scenario should be based the best available scientific information.</p>
<p>Where the zero TAC advice is given for a target stock subject to a MAP the catch scenarios for the zero TAC stock should include scenarios consistent the F<sub>MSY</sub> range in the target stock (e.g., F<sub>MSY</sub>, F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> and intermediate values) and quantify the corresponding changes in biomass. Where possible, F scenarios that give, a stable biomass and increasing biomass (if F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges do not) should also be provided. </p>
<p>Where possible ICES should provide catch scenarios which include changes in fishing pattern if they considered likely by ICES.</p>
<p>For stocks which are typically not caught in mixed fisheries (e.g., herring) but where ICES is advising zero TACs and where a monitoring fishery would be useful to monitor stock development, where possible ICES will provide catch scenarios for a monitoring TAC. This should be the minimum level of catches needed to provide sufficient data for ICES to continue providing scientific advice on the state of this stock.</p></em>
<h4>Cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em> in divisions 7.e-k</h4>
<p>Cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em>  in divisions 7.e-k is a target species in the EU multiannual management plan (EU MAP; EU, 2019). The zero-catch advice provided by ICES for this stock is based on precautionary considerations. The mixed-fisheries analysis shows that cod is caught in most mixed fisheries in the Celtic Sea with other species for which non-zero catches are advised. The present technical service provides illustrative catch scenarios consistent with the lower F<sub>MSY</sub> range for haddock as detailed below.</p>
<p>For cod in divisions 7.e-k:</p>
<ul><li> 1002 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at F<sub>MSY</sub> this would result in a cod spawning-stock biomass (SSB) of 1261 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> 717 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished at F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 1671 tonnes in 2024;</li>
<li> 869 tonnes are estimated to be caught when haddock is fished midway between F<sub>MSY</sub> and F<sub>MSY Lower</sub>; this would result in a cod SSB of 1450 tonnes in 2024;</li>
</ul>
<p>The haddock F<sub>MSY</sub>, haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> - F<sub>MSY</sub> and haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> scenarios result in an increase in cod SSB relative to 2023 (1053 tonnes). All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (4200 tonnes) in 2024.</p>
<p>It is not possible to provide catch scenarios that include changes in the fishing pattern. The above scenarios assume a fixed fishing pattern in 2023 [based on average (2019-2021)]. Future changes in the fishing pattern depend on management measures and the response of the fishery, which cannot be predicted by ICES.</p>
<p>Since cod are bycaught in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p>
<h4>Cod in Division 6.a, Cod in Division 7.a and whiting in Division 7.a </h4>
<p>ICES has provided estimates of the likely catches of several stocks under the assumption that TACs for the target stocks are set in line with ICES advice.</p>
<ul><li> For cod in Division 6.a, catches in 2023 are estimated to be between 1642 tonnes and 2562 tonnes, assuming fishing mortality on cod does not change or increases by the same proportion as the change advised for haddock. Under the scenario resulting in lower catch, spawning-stock biomass (SSB) in 2024 is expected to decrease by 5.6% while the higher catch option is expected to result in a decrease in SSB of 44%.</li>
<li>For cod in Division 7.a, catches in 2023 are estimated to be around 159 tonnes, assuming that the fishing mortality on cod changes by the same proportion as the changes advised for haddock and <em>Nephrops</em> fleets and that the fleets operate in a similar way as in the past 3 years. Under this scenario spawning-stock biomass (SSB) in 2024 is expected to increase by 6.4% from 2023 to 2024.</li><li> For whiting in Division 7.a, forecasted bycatch levels in 2023 are 1125 tonnes, using a model of whiting bycatch in the <em>Nephrops</em> fishery and assuming 8476 tonnes of <em>Nephrops</em> catches in 2023. This is expected to result in a 1% increase in 2023.</li></ul>
<h4>Herring <em>(Clupea harengus)</em> in divisions 7.a South of 52&deg30'N, 7.g-h, and 7.j-k (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and southwest of Ireland)</h4>
<p>ICES has provided forecasts on the development of herring <em>(Clupea harengus)</em> in divisions 7.a South of 52&deg30'N, 7.g-h, and 7.j-k (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and southwest of Ireland). All scenarios assumed full uptake of the monitoring TAC in the intermediate year (2022). There are no catch scenarios that will rebuild the stock above B<sub>lim</sub> by 2024. ICES, therefore, advises zero catch in 2023. ICES has also provided a catch scenario consistent with the monitoring TAC (869 tonnes [t]) in the single stock advice sheet (ICES 2019).</p>

","<h3>Request</h3>

</ul>
<p>The haddock F<sub>MSY</sub>, haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> - F<sub>MSY</sub> and haddock F<sub>MSY Lower</sub> scenarios result in an increase in cod SSB relative to 2023 (1053 tonnes). All scenarios result in an SSB below B<sub>lim</sub> (4200 tonnes) in 2024.</p>
<p>It is not possible to provide catch scenarios that include changes in the fishing pattern. The above scenarios assume a fixed fishing pattern in 2023 [based on average (2019-2021)].

<p>Since cod are bycaught in mixed fisheries, a specific monitoring TAC would likely not be required for this stock.</p>
<h4>Cod in Division 6.a, Cod in Division 7.a and whiting in Division 7.a </h4>
<p>ICES has provided estimates of the likely catches of several stocks under the assumption that TACs for the target stocks are set in line with ICES advice.</p>
<ul><li> For cod in Division 6.a, catches in 2023 are estimated to be between 1642 tonnes and 2562 tonnes, assuming fishing mortality on cod does not change or increases by the same proportion as the change advised for haddock.

This is expected to result in a 1% increase in 2023.</li></ul>
<h4>Herring <em>(Clupea harengus)</em> in divisions 7.a South of 52&deg30'N, 7.g-h, and 7.j-k (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and southwest of Ireland)</h4>
<p>ICES has provided forecasts on the development of herring <em>(Clupea harengus)</em> in divisions 7.a South of 52&deg30'N, 7.g-h, and 7.j-k (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, and southwest of Ireland). All scenarios assumed full uptake of the monitoring TAC in the intermediate year (2022). There are no catch scenarios that will rebuild the stock above B<sub>lim</sub> by 2024. ICES, therefore, advises zero catch in 2023. ICES has also provided a catch scenario consistent with the monitoring TAC (869 tonnes [t]) in the single stock advice sheet (ICES 2019).</p>

FisheriesOverview,"<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2023</h3>

<p>The ICES Fisheries Overview provides and overview of fisheries in the broader Celtic Sea Ecoregion.  This advice provides a summary of who is fishing, trends in catches over time, descriptions of fisheries, summary of management, the status of fisheries resources, mixed fisheries and multi-species interactions, effects of fisheries on the ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The commercial fisheries in the Celtic Sea target a large number of stocks. The pelagic fisheries, which account for the largest catches (by weight) in the region are the mid-water trawl fisheries for blue whiting, mackerel, horse mackerel, herring, boarfish, and sprat. The largest demersal fishery targets hake along the shelf edge using gillnets and longlines. There are also large mixed bottom-trawl fisheries targeting benthic species, Norway lobster, and gadoids. The species composition of these mixed fisheries tends to vary, depending on the area and the countries involved in the fishery.</p>
<p>The relationship of biomass status or the fishing mortality to reference points is not known for 60% of the 107 stocks that are assessed in the ecoregion. Though only 31% of the stocks are fished below F<sub>MSY</sub>, these stocks account for nearly 44% of the total landings. There has been a trend of declining fishing mortality since the mid-1990s for the benthic and demersal stocks with known status. The average F/F<sub>MSY</sub> ratio is below 1 for assessed benthic stocks and just above for the assessed demersal stocks. The trend for stock size in assessed benthic and demersal stocks has been increasing over the same period. The average F/F<sub>MSY</sub> ratio is below 1 for the crustacean stocks and the average biomass has been above 1 in the past decade. The average F/F<sub>MSY</sub> ratio for pelagic assessed stocks has been above 1 in recent years, and the average stock size indicator is declining in recent years but remains above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. </p>
<p>Technical interactions in demersal mixed fisheries are described for three areas within the ecoregion. Norway lobster account for the highest landings in the Irish Sea; they are mainly taken in trawl fisheries where they account for more than 90% of the total landings. In the Celtic Sea and west of Ireland hake account for the majority of the landings; they are mainly taken in longline and gillnet fisheries which are also dominated by hake. In the west of Scotland Norway lobster again account for the highest landings; they are mainly taken using otter trawls, but also in pots.</p>
