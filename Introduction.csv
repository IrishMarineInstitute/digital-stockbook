About the Stock Book,"<h3>About the Stock Book</h3> <p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet. It provides the latest scientific advice developed in 2023, which informs fishing opportunities for 2024 and management of other ecosystem services and effects. The Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute (MI) since 1993 and has evolved considerably over time. It continues to evolve to meet the needs of decision makers and stakeholders while addressing evolving EU and national legislation and policies. </p> <p>The majority of the scientific advice presented in the Stock Book is formulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). Relevant scientific advice from the EU's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICATT) are also used. The Stock Book draws on both the ICES and relevant STECF material and the resultant scientific advice it contains relates to those stocks exploited by the Irish fleet, which are managed under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The provision of scientific advice on fisheries resources is a key pillar of the CFP and informs the basis for the management decisions made under the CFP (e.g. annual fishing opportunities and technical measures). </p> <p>Scientific fisheries advice is developed by the Marine Institute staff working with other international scientists, and produced via international organisations such as ICES and ICCAT, and expert committees of the EU such as STECF. This advice is based upon the latest available data, research, assessments and information on the fisheries resource. Assessment data, Irish and EU sampling programmes are co-ordinated  international through Region Coordination Groups (<a href=""https://www.fisheries-rcg.eu/rcg-nansea/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fisheries-rcg.eu/rcg-nansea/</a>) .Scientific fisheries advice is formulated by consensus, which does not imply unanimity of all experts but allows the expert groups and the international scientific organisations to communicate an advice based on best available science. </p>  <p>The information contained within the Stock Book informs the decision making process around setting fishing opportunities for the following year and it serves as a reference throughout the year at other fisheries management meetings. The Stock Book is also aimed at a wider audience, including the fishing industry, marine scientists, managers, environmental NGO's, third level institutes, financial institutions and those with an interest in the pressure on and state of marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland. The Stock Book makes use of many technical terms and acronyms; these are explained in the ""Definition of fisheries technical terms and acronyms"" (see navigation pane). </p><p>From 2023 Marine Institute have held virtual briefing meeting with stakeholders on the ICES advice three times a year, shortly after the main advice releases at the end of June, end of September and end of October. These briefings give an opportunity to explain the advice and to get feedback from stakeholder. The Marine Institute also meet with stakeholders on a regular basis throughout the year to explain how advice is formulated and to discuss fisheries issues e.g. through the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership forum, which consists of industry representatives, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. </p> <p>The Stock Book is available electronically on the Marine Institute's web site at <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/"" target=""_blank"">www.marine.ie</a>. and as an interactive app which can be found at <a href=""https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/"" target=""_blank"">https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/</a>. We will endeavour to keep the electronic versions of the Stock Book up to date with any amendments which are released by the advisory authorities after this version goes to print. </p> <p>While every effort has been made to ensure that the Stock Book contains the most up-to-date and accurate information, the final ICES, ICCAT, STECF reports and various cited reports should be consulted for the definitive advice. More detailed information on specific stocks is available in the relevant ICES Working Group Reports. Definitive information on TAC areas and quota allocations should be obtained from the official EU Journal.</p> <h4>Fish Production, Fishing Fleets, Employment</h4> <p><em>The following information is taken from the latest version of ""European Commission, Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Facts and Figures on the Common Fisheries Policy : basic statistical data : 2022, Publications Office of the European Union, 2022, <a href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2771/737237"" target=""_blank"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2771/737237</a></em> "" </p> <em><h4>Fish Production</h4> </em> <p>The EU accounted for 6,191,066 tonnes of fish production (catches and aquaculture) in 2019, which represents about 2.9% of global production. The EU had about 5.2% of global fisheries catches in 2019. Although the EU fleets operate worldwide, EU catches are taken primarily in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Eastern Central Atlantic. The greatest volume species in EU catches are Atlantic herring, European sprat, Blue whiting, Atlantic mackerel and Skipjack tuna, which together account for almost 42% of EU catches. Spain, Denmark, the UK and France account for over 54% of the catches (note: the UK is no longer an EU member since Jan 2021 but was at the time of the report). Ireland accounted for 4.94% of EU total catches in 2019. </p> <em><h4>Fishing Fleets </h4> </em> <p>Fleet capacity management is an essential tool for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, which is one of the main objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy. The EU fishing fleet is very diverse, with vessels ranging from under six metres to over 75. The total number of EU fishing vessels in 2021 was 74,635 (6,186 fewer than in July 2013 for the 27 Member States that now make up the EU) with a gross tonnage of about 1.32 million tonnes, a combined engine power of 5.3 million kW, and an average age of 31.5 years. Vessels >24m account for 3% of the overall fleet, and make up 64% of the gross tonnage. Ireland has 1,935 vessels (2.6% of EU total), with a gross tonnage of 58,954 tonnes (4.5% of EU total) and an engine power of 173,852 kW (3.3% of EU total). Over the past 24 years, the EU fishing fleet capacity has declined in terms of both tonnage and engine power. Overall, the EU fleet was profitable in 2019. This consolidates the gradual recovery in recent years, during which both the gross profit and the net profit margin of the fleet have shown an upward trend. </p> <em><h4>Employment </h4> </em> <p>In several EU regions the fishing sector plays a crucial role in employment and economic activity - in some European coastal communities as many as half the local jobs are in the fishing sector. Employment in the fishing sector tends to be concentrated in a handful of countries. Spain alone accounts for a quarter of total employment, and the three countries with the highest levels of employment (Spain, Italy and Greece) make up around 62%. In Ireland 2,758 people are employed in fisheries (2019 figure), and 3,138 in processing (2017 figure). </p> <em><h4>The Fisheries Resource </h4> </em> <p>The seas around Ireland are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. In 2022 Irish vessels landed 156,941 tonnes into Irish Ports, worth an estimated &#8364 296 million with an additional &#8364 32.2 million landed by Irish Vessels abroad (<a href=""https://www.sfpa.ie/Statistics/Annual-statistics/Annual-Statistics/20 "" target=""_blank"">SFPA, 2023</a> ). The most valuable species landed was mackerel with a first sale value of ~&#8364 78 million, followed by <em>Nephrops</em> (~&#8364 71 million), horse mackerel (~&#8364 17 million), anglerfish (~&#8364 17 million),  and hake (~&#8364 11 million) . </p> <p>Most of the fisheries resources within the area come under the remit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Ireland's quota total share of these TAC's in 2023 amounted to 164,990 tonnes (see 'Irelands TAC' tab in this section)</p> <p>The ""2023 Irish quota in tonnes "" table (found in 'Irelands TAC' tab) does not include the valuable shellfish fisheries (e.g. crab, lobster, whelk, scallops, etc.), worth around ~&#8364 64 million annually, which are not managed by TACs but do come within the remit of the CFP. These shellfish fisheries resources represent a very important resource base for the coastal communities around Ireland and are particularly targeted in inshore areas (<a href=""https://oar.marine.ie/handle/10793/1814"" target=""_blank"">Marine Institute & Bord Iascaigh Mhara, 2023</a> ).</p> ","<h3>About the Stock Book</h3> <p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet.

In recent years sampling and surveys programmes were adapted to maintain adequate data collection. In 2022 Russia was suspended from ICES, while there was disruption on the data flows and to stock assessment processes in some areas, this did not significantly impact on the ability of the scientific community to provide 2023 advice for most stocks in western waters. Where issues did occur these are detailed in the 2022 Stock Book. </p> <p>The information contained within the Stock Book informs the decision making process around setting fishing opportunities for the following year and it serves as a valuable reference throughout the year at other fisheries management meetings.

Rationale,"<h3>Rationale for ICES Advice and the Commission Proposal on Fishing Opportunities for 2024 </h3> <p>The ICES approach to advice on fishing opportunities integrates the precautionary approach (PA) with the objective of achieving maximum sustainable yield (MSY), unless otherwise requested  (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_fishing_opportunities_2023_/22240624"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2023</a>). The aim is, in accordance with the aggregate of international guidelines, to inform policies for high, long-term yields while maintaining productive fish stocks in marine ecosystems that meet expected environmental standards (e.g. good environmental status [GES] in the EU).  ICES provides advice in line with its advisory framework (see Figure 1 in <a href=""https://iceslibrary.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_fishing_opportunities_2023_/22240624"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2023</a>). For category 1 and 2 stocks (stocks with analytical assessments), advice is given according to the ICES MSY approach or agreed management precautionary management plans (provided they have been adopted by all the relevant management authorities). Recently, ICES has developed new methods to provide advice for stocks in category 2 and 3 (stocks with analytical or survey-based assessments that are indicative of trends only). This is being phased in since 2021 (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/ICES_technical_guidance_for_harvest_control_rules_and_stock_assessments_for_stocks_in_categories_2_and_3/19801564"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2023</a>) and results in MSY or PA advice for category 3 stock depending on the applicable methodology. For category 4, 5, and 6 stocks, data limited stocks, ICES gives advice according to the precautionary approach.</p><p>Each year the European Commission reports on the progress made towards sustainable fishing in the EU and reviews the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the sector's socioeconomic performance and the landing obligation implementation. It then presents the main orientations that will shape the Commission's proposals and consultations with third countries on fishing opportunities for 2024 (<a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023DC0303"" target=""_blank"">http://COM(2023) 303 final</a>). Again this year the Commission highlight how Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has impacted fisheries from several perspectives: disruptions in trade flows; impact on the provision of scientific advice and certain negotiations at international level; and to increased energy prices.  This shows the importance of developing resilience to ensure food security in Europe, and of meeting the Green Deal objectives, especially through further innovation and energy transition.</p><p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out the key stages towards setting the next fishing opportunities.  The Commission will base its 2024 proposals for Fishing Opportunities (FOs) on the scientific advice issued by the ICES and STECF, including ecosystem considerations, on the decisions taken during international negotiations with third countries, on decisions taken by the RFMOs in 2023 and on a socio-economic analysis. The Commission invites Member States and stakeholders to assess the scientific advice as soon as it is publicly available. Stakeholders can also make recommendations through Advisory Councils, national authorities and individually. The Commission will conduct various consultations with the UK, Norway and other coastal states starting in October, with the aim of concluding in time to process the outcome into the December Council.</p><p>For shared stocks managed with the UK, Norway and other coastal states, the EU will continue to base its position on the best available scientific advice, with the objective of setting FOs in line with MSY. The EU will follow up on joint EU-UK commitments in the Specialised Committee on Fisheries, with the aim of achieving sustainable fishing and management of shared stocks. It will follow up on similar commitments in the trilateral framework (EU, UK, Norway), and in seeking sustainable and comprehensive sharing arrangements for coastal state stocks. This work is part of the external dimension of the common fisheries policy and covers some 70% of all TACs set in the Northeast Atlantic. The Commission will endeavour to improve cooperation and the climate of these consultations. </p><p>The Commission conclude that ""As stated in the Fisheries and Oceans package, we now need to see a greater commitment to make our marine areas and European fisheries fit for the future. A thriving fisheries sector is key to preserving European coastal communities and to managing the transition to more sustainable food systems.""</p>
","<h3>Rationale for ICES Advice and the Commission Proposal on Fishing Opportunities for 2023 </h3> <p>The ICES approach to advice on fishing opportunities integrates the precautionary approach (PA) with the objective of achieving maximum sustainable yield (MSY), unless otherwise requested  (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_fishing_opportunities_2022_/19928060"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a>). The aim is, in accordance with the aggregate of international guidelines, to inform policies for high, long-term yields while maintaining productive fish stocks in marine ecosystems that meet expected environmental standards (e.g. good environmental status [GES] in the EU).  ICES provides advice in line with its advisory framework (see Figure 1 in <a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_fishing_opportunities_2022_/19928060"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a>). For category 1 and 2 stocks (stocks with analytical assessments), advice is given according to the ICES MSY approach or agreed management precautionary management plans (provided they have been adopted by all the relevant management authorities). Recently, ICES has developed new methods to provide advice for stocks in category 2 and 3 (stocks with analytical or survey-based assessments that are indicative of trends only). This is being phased in since 2021 (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/ICES_technical_guidance_for_harvest_control_rules_and_stock_assessments_for_stocks_in_categories_2_and_3/19801564"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a>) and results in MSY or PA advice for category 3 stock depending on the applicable methodology. For category 4, 5, and 6 stocks, data limited stocks, ICES gives advice according to the precautionary approach.</p><p>Each year the European Commission reports on the progress made towards sustainable fishing in the EU and reviews the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the sector's socioeconomic performance and the landing obligation implementation. It then presents the main orientations that will shape the Commission's proposals and consultations with third countries on fishing opportunities for 2023 (<a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022DC0253"" target=""_blank"">http://COM(2022) 253 final</a>). This year the Commission highlight how Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has impacted fisheries from several perspectives: disruptions in trade flows; impact on the provision of scientific advice and certain negotiations at international level; and to increased energy prices.  This shows the importance of developing resilience to ensure food security in Europe, and of meeting the Green Deal objectives, especially through further innovation and energy transition.</p><p>The Commission highlight that ""In 2020, overall fishing pressure in EU waters continued to decrease, and the status of stocks to improve. It is particularly welcome to see that, thanks to the efforts made by the sector, in 2020 the overall fishing mortality ratio fell below 1 in the North East Atlantic for the first time. However, certain other stocks remain overfished and/or outside safe biological limits, which calls for further progress to reach the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP). Advice by STECF and ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) indicates that levels of unwanted catches remain high in many mixed demersal fisheries in EU waters. Control and enforcement of the landing obligation remain problematic.""</p><p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out the key steps towards setting the next fishing opportunities.  In the first instance the Commission will base its proposals on ICES and STECF scientific advice, on the decisions taken during bilateral negotiations with third countries, on decisions taken by the RFMOs in 2022 and on a socio-economic analysis. The Commission invites Member States and stakeholders to consider the scientific advice as soon as it is publicly available. Stakeholders can also make recommendations through the Advisory Councils and national authorities.  The Commission will conduct various consultations with the UK, Norway and Coastal States between October and December 2022, with the aim of concluding in time to process the outcome into the December AGRIFISH Council.</p><p>For stocks shared with third countries (UK, Norway, Coastal States), the number of TACs set in line with the scientific advice has increased in 2022, both for stocks with MSY advice and for those receiving precautionary advice. For 2023, the EU will build on the 2022 exercise and continue to pursue sustainable TACs in line with the scientific advice, as provided for under the CFP and the TCA. The Commission will seek to start the consultations, notably with the UK and with Norway, as early as possible in the autumn, subject to the availability of the scientific advice. </p><p>Beyond the state of fisheries resources, attention must also be given to the wider marine ecosystems. In that spirit, the Commission is preparing an Action Plan to conserve fisheries resources and protect marine ecosystems. It will aim at further protecting sensitive species and habitats, with measures supported by an improved knowledge base, enhancing synergies between fisheries and environmental stakeholders, and supporting the sector to ensure a fair and just transition. Such support will remain key in the coming months and years to ensure fisheries' resilience in particular in the context of the Russia's military aggression against Ukraine and the ecological and climate crisis.</p>

Sustainability Ass,"<h3>FEAS ADVICE FOR 2024</h3> <p><p>FEAS advise that the number of sustainably fished stocks has declined from 40 (in 2022) to 38 (in 2023): 51% of 74 reference stocks. The number of stocks with biomasses higher than sustainable trigger levels has increased from 36 (in 2022) to 38 (in 2023): 51% of 74. There is a long-term trend towards increasing sustainable use of these resources since 2012.</p><hr/> <h3>Results</h3> <p>ICES and ICCAT evaluate the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators.  These indicators are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to an F target (F<sub>MSY</sub> or a proxy of F<sub>MSY</sub>) and SSB in the year of the assessment in relation to a biomass trigger point (below which fishing mortality should be reduced). For some stocks ICES or ICCAT provide a qualitative assessment of the stock status if these reference points are not defined. The MI aims to gives overview of progress towards management targets by reporting of the status of 74 fish stocks that are of relevance to Ireland in a consistent way each year in the Stock Book. </p><p>Table 1 summarises the fishing pressure status relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> of the 74 reference stocks and compares with the same evaluation presented in previous years' Stock Books. The number of sustainably fished stocks hasdeclined by two to 38 (just over half the stocks evaluated; 51%). The percentage (24%) and number of stocks (18) overfished has increased by two compared to last year. The number of stocks with unknown status has decreased from 19 to 18 (24%)</p><p>Table 2 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points with the same evaluation presented in previous years.  The number of stocks that are above MSY biomass trigger points has increased to 38 (51%) but the number of stocks below MSY biomass trigger points has also increased to 18 (24%). The number of stocks with unknown biomass status has decreased from 24 to 18 (24%) this year.</p> <p>There are multiple reasons why stocks have unknown status including: short time series of biological data, conflicting input data, low catches and/or insufficient sampling data or missing catch information (e.g. angling catches or discards). Over time the percentage of stocks with unknown pressure and state indicators has declined. However, when ICES undertakes a benchmark and the assessment issues cannot be resolved stocks may be downgraded and their status in relation to reference points becomes unknown. It is likely that the status of some stocks will remain with unknown pressure or state category and the management and advisory framework should take this into account.</p><h3>Detailed analysis</h3><p>A detailed breakdown of the evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in previous Stock Books is presented in Table 3. Note that the stock status in a certain year may retrospectively be adjusted as more data become available. These adjustments are not included in Table 3; the table represents the data as it was reported at the time. The stock status of individual stocks varies over time but there is a clear overall trend, showing an increasing number of stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> and with biomasses (SSB) above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> since 2012 (see Figure 1 below).  This demonstrates a gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base.</p><p>The status of 11 stocks changed between the 2022 and 2023 assessments.

These changes are highlighted in Table 4 and described below.</p><p>The status of F in relation to F<sub>MSY</sub> changed for 19 stocks. Six stocks which were assessed to be sustainably fished last year saw increases in fishing mortality above F<sub>MSY</sub> (Haddock 7b-k, Horse mackerel W, Mackerel NEA, <em>Nephrops</em> FU13, Plaice 7fg, Sole 7a). The two herring stocks (Herring 6aN, Herring 6aS,7bc) were split after a benchmark and both are now also assessed as sustainably fished.  Because F<sub>MSY</sub> is a target reference point, it is to be expected that a well-managed stock will fluctuate slightly around F<sub>MSY</sub>. Three stocks that were previously overfished are now exploited below F<sub>MSY</sub>  (Haddock 6b, Plaice 7hjk, Sole 7fg). The exploitation status for 6 stocks changed from unknown to sustainably exploited (Cuckoo ray 6,7,8abd, Porbeagle NEA, Spotted ray 6,7bj, Spotted ray 7ae-h, Thornback ray 7afg, Undulate ray 7de), while the exploitation status two stocks changed from unknown to over exploited (Anglerfish 3a,4,6 and Thornback ray 6).</p><p>The status of SSB in relation to the reference points changed for 16 stocks. One stocks is now considered to have recovered above the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (Spurdog NEA) while 10 stocks have changed to unknown biomass status to above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> or the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> proxy (Anglerfish 3a,4,6, Anglerfish (black) 7,8, Cuckoo ray 6,7,8abd, Plaice 7hjk, Small-eyed ray 7fg, Spotted ray 6,7bj, Spotted ray 7ae-h, Thornback ray 6, Thornback ray 7afg, Undulate ray 7de). One stock fell below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> proxy (Plaice 7fg) and two stocks changed to unknown biomass status to below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (Cod 7a, Porbeagle NEA).  The two herring stocks (Herring 6aN, Herring 6aS,7bc) were split after a benchmark and both have unknown status of SSB in relation to the reference points.

LongTermManagement plans,"<h3>Long Term Management Plans</h3> <p>Several of the stocks of interest to Ireland are or have been managed under Long Term Management plans. Details on these plans are given in the table below. Normally the process of formulation and adoption of these plans has required scientific input to generate and test a harvest control rule (HCR) which is used as part of the setting TAC procedure. These plans are normally proposed by the competent management authority (e.g. European Commission and/or coastal states), tested for adherence to the precautionary approach and maximum sustainable yield by ICES and then could be adopted by the management authorities. </p> <p> Since 2016 the Commission has developed multiannual sea basin plans for demersal species caught together in multi species fisheries. The sea basin plans have been adopted already for the Baltic Sea (2016/1193), and the North Sea (2016/0238), and in 2019 for the Atlantic area which is referred to as Western Waters (2019/472). These plans are commonly referred to as Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). The stocks included in the Western Waters MAP and those in the North Sea MAP of relevance to Ireland are given in the Appendix IX document below (scroll down this page). The MAPs set out to achieve the objectives of the CFP, facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation and promote a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities. Because ICES gives advice in the context of the policies of several clients, ICES only gives headline MAP advice for stocks that are fished by the EU only. Since the majority of western waters stocks are fished with the UK, the MAP is only used as the headline advice for a handful of stocks, while catch scenarios are provided in the table below, consistent with the MSY ranges. </p><p> The framework for providing advice is given below. It should be noted that ICES also applies an advice rule when stock fall below a MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point. This implies that the F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are scaled when the SSB is below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (by SSB/MSYB<sub>trigger</sub>). It should also be noted that when no F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are available ICES defaults to a PA approach for the advice. This is the case for some target stocks in the MAPs such as pollack and anglerfish in areas 4 & 6. </p> <p>The applicable advice basis is dependent on the following series of points:<ul><li> Is the stock listed in an EU MAP and not fished by other countries? </li> <li> Is there a range (upper and lower values) defined for the stock? </li> <li> In the assessment of the stock, is spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point? </li> <li> Is the SSB above the B<sub>lim</sub> reference point? </li> <li> If there is no catch option to bring SSB above B<sub>lim</sub> in the catch advice year, zero catch advice is given. </li></ul></p>","<p>Several of the stocks of interest to Ireland are or have been managed under Long Term Management plans.
