About the Stock Book,"<h3>About the Stock Book</h3> <p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet. It provides the latest scientific advice developed in 2022, which informs fishing opportunities for 2023. The Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute (MI) since 1993 and has evolved considerably over time. It continues to evolve to meet the needs of decision makers and stakeholders while addressing evolving EU and national legislation and policies. </p> <p>The majority of the scientific advice presented in the Stock Book is formulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). Relevant scientific advice from the EU's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICATT) are also used. The Stock Book draws on both the ICES and relevant STECF material and the resultant scientific advice it contains relates to those stocks exploited by the Irish fleet, which are managed under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The provision of scientific advice on fisheries resources is a key pillar of the CFP and informs the basis for the management decisions made under the CFP (e.g. annual fishing opportunities and technical measures). </p> <p>Scientific fisheries advice is developed by the Marine Institute staff working with other international scientists, and produced via international organisations such as ICES and ICCAT, and expert committees of the EU such as STECF. This advice is based upon the latest available data, research, assessments and information on the fisheries resource. Assessment data, Irish and EU sampling programmes are co-ordinated  international through Region Coordination Groups (<a href=""https://www.fisheries-rcg.eu/rcg-nansea/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fisheries-rcg.eu/rcg-nansea/</a>) .Scientific fisheries advice is formulated by consensus, which does not imply unanimity of all experts but allows the expert groups and the international scientific organisations to communicate an advice based on best available science. </p> <p>Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy crises arising from the war in Ukraine have impacted negatively on the fishing industry, and on the provision of scientific advice. In recent years sampling and surveys programmes were adapted to maintain adequate data collection. In 2022 Russia was suspended from ICES, while there was disruption on the data flows and to stock assessment processes in some areas, this did not significantly impact on the ability of the scientific community to provide 2023 advice for most stocks in western waters. Where issues did occur these are detailed in the 2022 Stock Book. </p> <p>The information contained within the Stock Book informs the decision making process around setting fishing opportunities for the following year and it serves as a valuable reference throughout the year at other fisheries management meetings. The Stock Book is also of interest to a wider audience, including the fishing industry, marine scientists, managers, environmental NGO's, third level institutes, financial institutions and those with an interest in the pressure on and state of marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland. The Stock Book makes use of many technical terms and acronyms; these are explained in the 'Definitions' section. </p><p>Marine Institute scientists meet with stakeholders on a regular basis throughout the year to explain how advice is formulated and to discuss fisheries issues e.g. through the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership forum, which consists of industry representatives, the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. Marine Institute scientists also host meetings for the environmental NGO's for the same purpose. </p> <p>The Stock Book is available electronically on the Marine Institute's web site at <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/"" target=""_blank"">www.marine.ie</a>. and as an interactive app which can be found at <a href=""https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/"" target=""_blank"">https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/</a>. We will endeavour to keep the electronic versions of the Stock Book up to date with any amendments which are released by the advisory authorities after this version goes to print. </p> <p>While every effort has been made to ensure that the Stock Book contains the most up-to-date and accurate information, the final ICES, ICCAT, STECF reports and various cited reports should be consulted for the definitive advice. More detailed information on specific stocks is available in the relevant ICES Working Group Reports. Definitive information on TAC areas and quota allocations should be obtained from the official EU Journal.</p> <h4>Fish Production, Fishing Fleets, Employment</h4> <p><em>The following information is taken from the latest version of ""European Commission, Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Facts and Figures on the Common Fisheries Policy : basic statistical data : 2022, Publications Office of the European Union, 2022, <a href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2771/737237"" target=""_blank"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2771/737237</a></em> "" </p> <em><h4>Fish Production</h4> </em> <p>The EU accounted for 6,191,066 tonnes of fish production (catches and aquaculture) in 2019, which represents about 2.9% of global production. The EU had about 5.2% of global fisheries catches in 2019. Although the EU fleets operate worldwide, EU catches are taken primarily in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Eastern Central Atlantic. The greatest volume species in EU catches are Atlantic herring, European sprat, Blue whiting, Atlantic mackerel and Skipjack tuna, which together account for almost 42% of EU catches. Spain, Denmark, the UK and France account for over 54% of the catches (note: the UK is no longer an EU member since Jan 2021 but was at the time of the report). Ireland accounted for 4.94% of EU total catches in 2019. </p> <em><h4>Fishing Fleets </h4> </em> <p>Fleet capacity management is an essential tool for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, and is one of the main objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy. The EU fishing fleet is very diverse, with vessels ranging from under six metres to over 75. The total number of EU fishing vessels in 2021 was 74,635 (6,186 fewer than in July 2013 for the 27 Member States that now make up the EU) with a gross tonnage of about 1.32 million tonnes, a combined engine power of 5.3 million kW, and an average age of 31.5 years. Vessels >24m account for 3% of the overall fleet, and make up 64% of the gross tonnage. Ireland has 1,935 vessels (2.6% of EU total), with a gross tonnage of 58,954 tonnes (4.5% of EU total) and an engine power of 173,852 kW (3.3% of EU total). For the past 24 years, the EU fishing fleet capacity has declined in terms of both tonnage and engine power. Overall, the EU fleet was profitable in 2019. This consolidates the gradual recovery in recent years, during which both the gross profit and the net profit margin of the fleet have shown an upward trend. </p> <em><h4>Employment </h4> </em> <p>In several EU regions the fishing sector plays a crucial role in employment and economic activity - in some European coastal communities as many as half the local jobs are in the fishing sector. Employment in the fishing sector tends to be concentrated in a handful of countries. Spain alone accounts for a quarter of total employment, and the three countries with the highest levels of employment (Spain, Italy and Greece) make up around 62%. In Ireland 2,758 people are employed in fisheries (2019 figure), and 3,138 in processing (2017 figure). </p> <em><h4>The Fisheries Resource </h4> </em> <p>The seas around Ireland are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. In 2021 Irish vessels landed 181,791 tonnes into Irish Ports, worth an estimated &#8364 267 million with an additional &#8364 36.3 million landed by Irish Vessels abroad (<a href=""https://www.sfpa.ie/Statistics/Annual-statistics/Annual-Statistics/20 "" target=""_blank"">SFPA, 2022</a> ). The most valuable species landed was mackerel with a first sale value of ~&#8364 70 million, followed by <em>Nephrops</em> (~&#8364 54 million), anglerfish (~&#8364 16 million), horse mackerel (~&#8364 17 million) and blue whiting (~&#8364 9 million) . </p> <p>Most of the fisheries resources within the area come under the remit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Ireland's quota total share of these TAC's in 2022 amounted to 158,639 tonnes</p> <p>The ""2021 Irish quota in tonnes and approximate value"" table (found in 'Irelands TAC' section) does not include the valuable shellfish fisheries (e.g. crab, lobster, whelk, scallops, etc.), worth around ~&#8364 58 million annually, which are not managed by TACs but do come within the remit of the CFP. These shellfish fisheries resources represent a very important resource base for the coastal communities around Ireland and are particularly targeted in inshore areas (<a href=""https://oar.marine.ie/handle/10793/1744"" target=""_blank"">Marine Institute & Bord Iascaigh Mhara, 2021</a> ).</p> ","<h3>About the Stock Book</h3> <p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet.

In Ireland 2,036 people are employed in fisheries (2015 figure), and 2,147 in processing (2016 figure). </p> <h4>The Fisheries Resource</h4> <p>The seas around Ireland are among the most productive and biologically sensitive areas in EU waters. Most of the fisheries resources within the area come under the remit of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The overall 2019 fishing opportunities (i.e. Total Allowable Catches, TAC's species) for stocks to which the Irish fleet has access to, were 1.15 million tonnes of fish, with an estimated landed value of &#8364 1.44 billion (Figure 1.1). Ireland's total share of these TACs in 2019 amounted to 193,924 tonnes with a value of &#8364 216 million. These figures represent stocks in Areas 6 and 7 as well as other areas and international waters. This economic value is based on 2018 average prices and represents a conservative estimate. Ireland's share of these fishing opportunities for 2019 represents 17% by tonnage and 15% by value.</p> <p>These values do not include the valuable inshore fisheries (e.g. lobster, whelk) which are not managed using internationally agreed TACs but do come within the remit of the CFP. These inshore fisheries resources represent a very important resource base for the coastal communities around Ireland.</p> <p>Ireland's share of a TAC (the Irish quota) varies depending on the stock concerned. Ireland has 86% of the Celtic Sea herring TAC; 69% of the boarfish; 37% of Nephrops in Area 7; 26% of horse mackerel and 21% of mackerel (EU TAC). For other stocks it has a much lower share of the TAC: 8% of anglerfish in Area 7 and 6% of northern hake (Figure 1.1). </p>","<p>The Stock Book is produced annually by the Marine Institute's Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS) team and provides up to date scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet. It provides the latest scientific advice developed in 2018, which informs fishing opportunities for 2019. The Stock Book has been published by the Marine Institute (MI) since 1993 and has evolved considerably over time. It continues to evolve in a changing fisheries advisory environment. </p> <p>The majority of the scientific advice presented in the Stock Book is formulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). Relevant scientific advice from the EU's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICATT) are also used. </p> <p>The majority of the ICES scientific advice is released in June each year. This is to facilitate consultation with industry and managers on available fishing opportunities for the coming year. ICES produces the remaining scientific advice in October and November. The STECF may also review the status of or give advice on certain fish stocks. The Stock Book draws on both the ICES and relevant STECF material and the resultant scientific advice it contains relates to those stocks exploited by the Irish fleet, which are managed under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The provision of scientific advice on fisheries resources is a key pillar of the CFP and informs the basis for the management decisions made under the CFP (e.g. annual fishing opportunities and technical measures). </p> <p>Scientific fisheries advice is developed by the Marine Institute working with other international scientists, and produced via International organisations such as ICES and ICCAT, and expert committees of the EU such as STECF. This advice is based upon the latest available research, assessments and information on the fisheries resource. It is formulated by consensus, which does not imply unanimity of all experts but allows the expert groups and the international scientific organisations to communicate an advice based on best available science. </p> <p>The Stock Book is presented annually to our primary client, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) each December. The information contained within the Stock Book is of vital importance in serving Ireland during the annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) negotiations at the various EU Council of Fisheries meetings, but principally at the December Council meeting. It also serves as a valuable reference throughout the year at other fisheries management meetings with the EU. The Stock Book is also of interest to a wider audience, including the fishing industry, marine scientists, managers, environmental NGO's, third level institutes, financial institutions and those with an interest in the status and management of marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland. For those reading the Stock Book without technical or scientific background, there are many terms and abbreviations the explanation of which can be found at the end of the book. The MI meets with stakeholders on a regular basis throughout the year, e.g. quarterly meetings between the MI & Industry using the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership forum, where a key agenda item focuses on how the data was collected and the advice was formulated. The MI also has regular meetings with the environmental NGO's for the same purpose. </p> <p>The Stock Book is also available electronically on the Marine Institute's web site at <a href=""https://www.marine.ie/Home/home"" target=""_blank"">www.marine.ie</a>. and this year an informatics interactive version of the Stock Book (and most recent editions) can be found at <a href=""https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/"" target=""_blank"">https://shiny.marine.ie/stockbook/</a> . </p> <p>While every effort has been made to ensure that the Stock Book contains the most up to date and accurate information, the final ICES, ICCAT, STECF reports and various cited reports should be consulted for the latest advice. More detailed information on specific stocks is available in the relevant ICES Working Group Reports. Definitive information on TAC areas and quota allocations should be obtained from the official EU Journal. </p> <h4>Fish Production, Fishing Fleets, Employment</h4> <p>The following information is taken from the latest version of ""Facts and Figures on the Common Fisheries Policy - 2018 Edition"" which is available on the EU website (DOI 10.2771).</p> <h4>Fish Production</h4> <p>The EU accounted for 6,467,338 tonnes of fish production (catches and aquaculture) in 2015, which represents about 3% of global production. The EU had about 5% of global fisheries catches in 2015. Although the EU fleets operate worldwide, EU catches are taken primarily in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Eastern Central Atlantic. The pelagic fish account for most of the landings (62% of the total landings), especially Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel and European sprat which account for more than a third of the catches. Spain, Denmark, the UK and France account for about 58% of the catches. </p> <h4>Fishing Fleets </h4> <p>Fleet capacity management is an essential tool for the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources, and is one of the main objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy. The EU fishing fleet is very diverse, with vessels ranging from under six metres to over 75. The total number of EU fishing vessels in 2017 was 83,117 with a gross tonnage of about 1.6 million tonnes, a combined engine power of 6.27 million kW, and an average age of 21.4 years. Ireland has 2,061 vessels (2.5% of EU total), with a gross tonnage of 62,373 tonnes (4% of EU total) and an engine power of 187,629 kW (3% of EU total). For the past 22 years, the EU fishing fleet capacity has declined in terms of both tonnage and engine power. Despite enlargements to the EU, the number of EU vessels in 2017 was 83,117, which is 20,717 fewer than in 1996.</p> <h4>Employment </h4> <p>In several EU regions the fishing sector plays a crucial role for employment and economic activity - in some European coastal communities as many as half the local jobs are in the fishing sector. Employment in the fishing sector tends to be concentrated in a handful of countries. Spain alone accounts for a quarter of total employment, and the four countries with the highest levels of employment (Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal) make up around 73%.

It also provides an overview of the format of the Stock Book and the approach taken in the formulation of the ICES advice and the EU Commission proposals for fishing opportunities for 2023.</p> <p>The Quality and Assurance section details the processes which underpin the quality assurance of data and information produced by the MI upon which scientific fisheries advice is dependent. </p> <p>The Stock Book provides a summary table on the status, scientific advice and proposed fishing opportunities for 2023 in the 'Advice Summary' section. This table is used to brief DAFM, Industry and the ENGOs on the latest scientific advice and is a valuable summary reference. This table is a summary reference and the individual advice sheets from ICES should be consulted for the details. </p> <p>The Sustainability Assessment provides information on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators. These are fishing mortality (F) in the last year of the assessment relative to F<sub>MSY</sub> (the fishing pressure which is expected to deliver maximum sustainable yield) and the spawning stock biomass (SSB) in the year of the assessment in relation to a defined biomass trigger point (below which the stock is at risk of recruitment impairment). An earlier version of this evaluation was presented by the Minister to the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the 25th of October 2022. The version here includes several additional stocks where ICES advice was released on the 28th of October 2022. </p> <p>A summary of the Good Environmental Status (GES) assessment in relation to Commercial Fish Stocks (Descriptor D3) based on Ireland's second cycle submission under Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in 2020 was provided in the 2020 Stock Book ( <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/10793/1660"" target=""_blank"">Marine Institute, 2020</a> ). </p> <p>A summary of the long-term management plans used as a basis for advice are also presented in the Stock Book. This section now deals primarily with the Multi Annual Plan for Western Waters (WWMAP) which is the primary framework for managing demersal stocks which can be caught in mixed fisheries.</p> <p>The section on mixed fisheries is not included in the printed version of the Stock Book this year because the ICES advice is scheduled after publication of this volume. This section will be added to the electronic version of the Stock Book in early December. The Marine Institute continues to play a key role in the development and delivery of mixed fisheries advice at ICES. </p> <p>The main part of the Stock Book contains the species information and the individual stock advice. The format is organised by species and then stocks rather than on an area-based approach (e.g. Irish Sea). The species overview provides information on the general biology, national and international landings distributions, Irish landings and values.</p> <p>The individual stock advice provides a summary of the advice for 2023, outlines key points in relation to the stock (i.e. ICES stock category, Advice Basis; Management Plan options -where relevant; Landing Obligation). The current management of the stock is also summarised and key considerations of relevance to the stock for Ireland is given. The complete ICES advice for the stock is also given for most stocks. </p> <p>This advice is principally based on MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield) considerations or agreed Management Plan considerations. The status of the stock in relation to the landing obligation and management plans are also given. The long-term management plans in place for stocks of Irish interest are shown in the 'Long Term Management Plan' section.</p> <p>The Management in 2022 section gives information on the 2022 TAC and quotas by country, and describes any mismatches between assessment area and management area.

Rationale,"<h3>Rationale for ICES Advice and the Commission Proposal on Fishing Opportunities for 2023 </h3> <p>The ICES approach to advice on fishing opportunities integrates the precautionary approach (PA) with the objective of achieving maximum sustainable yield (MSY), unless otherwise requested  (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_fishing_opportunities_2022_/19928060"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a>). The aim is, in accordance with the aggregate of international guidelines, to inform policies for high, long-term yields while maintaining productive fish stocks in marine ecosystems that meet expected environmental standards (e.g. good environmental status [GES] in the EU).  ICES provides advice in line with its advisory framework (see Figure 1 in <a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_fishing_opportunities_2022_/19928060"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a>). For category 1 and 2 stocks (stocks with analytical assessments), advice is given according to the ICES MSY approach or agreed management precautionary management plans (provided they have been adopted by all the relevant management authorities). Recently, ICES has developed new methods to provide advice for stocks in category 2 and 3 (stocks with analytical or survey-based assessments that are indicative of trends only). This is being phased in since 2021 (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/ICES_technical_guidance_for_harvest_control_rules_and_stock_assessments_for_stocks_in_categories_2_and_3/19801564"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a>) and results in MSY or PA advice for category 3 stock depending on the applicable methodology. For category 4, 5, and 6 stocks, data limited stocks, ICES gives advice according to the precautionary approach.</p><p>Each year the European Commission reports on the progress made towards sustainable fishing in the EU and reviews the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the sector's socioeconomic performance and the landing obligation implementation. It then presents the main orientations that will shape the Commission's proposals and consultations with third countries on fishing opportunities for 2023 (<a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52022DC0253"" target=""_blank"">http://COM(2022) 253 final</a>). This year the Commission highlight how Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has impacted fisheries from several perspectives: disruptions in trade flows; impact on the provision of scientific advice and certain negotiations at international level; and to increased energy prices.  This shows the importance of developing resilience to ensure food security in Europe, and of meeting the Green Deal objectives, especially through further innovation and energy transition.</p><p>The Commission highlight that ""In 2020, overall fishing pressure in EU waters continued to decrease, and the status of stocks to improve. It is particularly welcome to see that, thanks to the efforts made by the sector, in 2020 the overall fishing mortality ratio fell below 1 in the North East Atlantic for the first time. However, certain other stocks remain overfished and/or outside safe biological limits, which calls for further progress to reach the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP). Advice by STECF and ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) indicates that levels of unwanted catches remain high in many mixed demersal fisheries in EU waters. Control and enforcement of the landing obligation remain problematic.""</p><p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out the key steps towards setting the next fishing opportunities.  In the first instance the Commission will base its proposals on ICES and STECF scientific advice, on the decisions taken during bilateral negotiations with third countries, on decisions taken by the RFMOs in 2022 and on a socio-economic analysis. The Commission invites Member States and stakeholders to consider the scientific advice as soon as it is publicly available. Stakeholders can also make recommendations through the Advisory Councils and national authorities.  The Commission will conduct various consultations with the UK, Norway and Coastal States between October and December 2022, with the aim of concluding in time to process the outcome into the December AGRIFISH Council.</p><p>For stocks shared with third countries (UK, Norway, Coastal States), the number of TACs set in line with the scientific advice has increased in 2022, both for stocks with MSY advice and for those receiving precautionary advice. For 2023, the EU will build on the 2022 exercise and continue to pursue sustainable TACs in line with the scientific advice, as provided for under the CFP and the TCA. The Commission will seek to start the consultations, notably with the UK and with Norway, as early as possible in the autumn, subject to the availability of the scientific advice. </p><p>Beyond the state of fisheries resources, attention must also be given to the wider marine ecosystems. In that spirit, the Commission is preparing an Action Plan to conserve fisheries resources and protect marine ecosystems. It will aim at further protecting sensitive species and habitats, with measures supported by an improved knowledge base, enhancing synergies between fisheries and environmental stakeholders, and supporting the sector to ensure a fair and just transition. Such support will remain key in the coming months and years to ensure fisheries' resilience in particular in the context of the Russia's military aggression against Ukraine and the ecological and climate crisis.</p>
","<h3>Rationale for ICES Advice and the Commission Proposal on Fishing Opportunities for 2022 </h3> <p>Each year the European Commission reports on the progress made towards sustainable fishing in the EU and reviews the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities, the sector's socioeconomic performance and the landing obligation implementation. It then presents the main orientations that will shape the Commission's proposals and consultations with third countries on fishing opportunities for 2022 (<a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0279&from=EN"" target=""_blank"">http://COM(2021) 279 final</a>). </p> <p>A STECF analysis has shown that in the north-east Atlantic, the fishing pressure decreased and fish stocks grew in 2003-2019. In the early 2000s, the median indicator of fishing mortality was more than 1.7 times larger than MSY, but this has reduced and since 2011 stabilised below 1.2, getting close to 1 in 2019 (<a href=""https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/43805/55543/STECF+21-01++adhoc+-+CFP+Monitoring.pdf/7638e3df-5593-45e8-bf92-dd5e4423c7b3"" target=""_blank"">STECF, 2021</a>).</p> <p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out its approach to formulating these proposals, which are based on a consultative approach. In the first instance the Commission will base its proposals on ICES scientific catch advice. The Commission invites Member States and stakeholders to consider the scientific advice as soon as it is publicly available. Stakeholders can also make recommendations through the Advisory Councils and national authorities. For stocks managed with international partners and fishing opportunities on which scientific advice arrives later in the year, proposals will continue to include fishing opportunities in <em>pro memoria</em>. Opportunities for stocks managed with the UK and with UK and Norway will also be presented in this way, subject to timing and outcome of those consultations. </p> <p>Because of Brexit a large majority of Atlantic and North Sea stocks will no longer be decided upon by the EU exclusively, following the TCA with the UK. The TCA provides a strong basis for the sustainable management fish stocks with the UK transposing many of the CFP objectives into UK fisheries management policy. The EU will seek to realise this harmonised ambition in consultations on fishing opportunities and through the Specialised Committee on Fisheries (SCF) established under the TCA. For 'special stocks', i.e. stocks for which ICES advises a zero TAC; stocks caught in a mixed fishery if that stock or another stock in the same fishery is vulnerable; or other stocks which the Parties consider require special treatment, there will be negotiations through the SCF. </p> <p>Consultations with the UK and Norway take place between September and November, aiming for a timely conclusion ahead of the December Council where the Commission hopes to include the results into the 2022 TAC Regulation. Should no agreement with the UK be reached by 20 December 2021, the TCA provides for each Party to set provisional TACs applying from 1 January at the level advised by ICES, with TACs for special stocks set in accordance with the guidelines to be adopted by the Specialised Committee on Fisheries by 1 July 2021.</p>","<p>ICES gives advice in the context of the policy objectives of its clients. Thus ICES advice is based on a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) approach. Where possible ICES provides analytical forecasts with a catch option consistent with F<sub>MSY</sub>(or F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges) for 2021. Where the SSB in 2021 is forecasted to be below the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>, ICES advises on a lower F (scaled by the degree to which biomass in 2020 is below the trigger). For stocks where SSB is below B<sub>lim</sub>and there is no catch option which results in an SSB above B<sub>lim</sub>in the catch year, ICES gives a zero catch advice. In these cases, the Commissions approach has been to set an ""unavoidable"" by-catch TAC's at a low level, because setting TAC's to zero for species which are caught with other stocks would lead to a closure of multiple fisheries with serious socioeconomic impacts. For stocks where analytical forecasts are not possible ICES provides advice according to a set of procedures that follow the Precautionary Approach to fisheries management. </p> <p>The European Commission has first competency in making TAC proposals for the year ahead. The Commission has set out its approach to formulating these proposals, which are based on a consultative approach (COM(2020) 248 final): <em> ""Since 2020, fish stocks are to be managed in line with the maximum sustainable yield target. The main objective of the Commission's proposals for the Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea stocks will therefore be to maintain or reach maximum sustainable yield (F<em>MSY</em>) for MSY-assessed stocks 16 . The Commission will fully implement management plans. The Commission will propose either the MSY point value or make use of the MSY range indicated by ICES where this is legally possible under a multiannual plan. Where the ICES recommends that no catches be taken from target stocks, the focus will be on rebuilding these with remedial measures under the multiannual plans. The proposals will also continue to look at ways of facilitating the effective implementation of the landing obligation. Work with all stakeholders continues in order to ensure that stocks covered by these plans get full MSY scientific evaluation as soon as possible.""</em></p> <p>FEAS provides the summary below explaining the Commission's approach as outlined in the communications. These considerations are framed around implementing the MSY and landing obligation in the CFP bearing in mind that: <ol><li> some stocks are subject to negotiations with other parties (Norway and Coastal states)</li> <li> many demersal stocks are now covered by multi species Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs)</li> <li> the advice for some stocks is qualitative and they are managed by MSY proxies</li> <li> there are a small number of by-catch stocks (which will be managed according to PA). </li></ol> </p> <p>The Commission states that the proposed TACs shall set be in line with ICES scientific advice (COM(2020) 668 final). To take account of the full application of the landing obligation, the Commission proposes TACs on the basis of catch advice instead of previously used landings advice. The proposed Union quotas take account of the fact that certain limited discards based on established exemptions will occur, and thus will not be landed and counted against the quotas.</p> <p>Due to Brexit the Commission's initial proposals only contain fishing opportunities for two stocks of interest to Ireland. The stocks for which the Commission will need to consult with the UK on quota shares for fishing opportunities for 2021 and 2022 are therefore presented as pro memoria, pending the outcome of the ongoing negotiations regarding the cooperation on these stocks, including fishing opportunities, quota shares and access to the UK waters (COM(2020) 668 final).</p>","<p>ICES gives advice in the context of the policy objectives of its clients.

For certain stocks such as <em>Nephrops</em>, ICES advice does take the survivorship of unwanted catch (i.e. discards) into account and in these cases the most appropriate catch option from the ICES advice on which to base the TAC proposal, would be ""wanted catch"" (i.e. landings).</p>","<p>ICES gives advice in the context of the policy objectives of its clients.

The Commission has set out its approach to formulating these proposals. In 2018 these proposals are tightly aligned with ICES advice. FEAS provides the summary below explaining the Commission's approach, and outlining the communication ''COM (2017) 368 final''.</p> <p>The overarching approach was published in ''COM (2017) 368 final'' on July 7th 2017. The document sets out 4 key considerations in the way the Commission would initiate TAC proposals for 2017: <ol><li> Stocks with MSY assessment</li> <li> Stocks under multiannual plans</li> <li>Other stocks <ol type=""A""><li> Stocks with data available to determine MSY proxies</li> <li> Stocks with survey-based trends or with advice based only on catch time series</li> <li> 26 stocks where TACs will not be altered (stability)</li> <li> Stocks without biological advice</li></ol></li> <li> Stocks coming under the Landing Obligation in 2018</li></ol> <p>1. For Stocks with MSY assessment, the proposed TACs shall be in line with achieving F<sub>MSY</sub> the following year (2018). A commitment to set TACs at point estimates of F<sub>MSY</sub> was also contained in last year's proposal. However that was conditioned by a more general commitment towards achieving that target by 2020. For the first time, in 2017, the Commission unequivocally seeks F<sub>MSY</sub> in TAC setting in the following year. The underlying basis of the Commission's approach is Article 2.2 of the 2013 Common Fisheries Policy. This article states that stocks must be maintained ''above levels which can produce'' MSY. This is a looser interpretation of MSY than that contained in COM (2017) 368 final.</p> <p>For stocks that are shared with non-EU countries (straddling stocks), the Commission seeks agreement on the same basis. However, several of these stocks have, to date, been managed on the basis of agreed long term management strategies which are not necessarily compatible with achieving F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018. While these management strategies have been assessed by ICES in terms of compatibility with MSY and the PA, management strategy features such as constraints on inter-annual TAC change mean that F<sub>MSY</sub> may not be achievable in 2018.</p> <p>2. For stocks under multiannual plans, the TAC proposals shall be set in accordance with the plan only if this achieves harvesting at F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018.</p> <p>There are also a number of internal EU multiannual plans, with TAC constraints, which do not necessarily achieve F<sub>MSY</sub> in the following year. These cover various sole stocks and Celtic Sea herring. Only the plans for North Sea sole and Celtic Sea herring are deemed precautionary by ICES, though the Biscay sole plan was approved by STECF. All three have been used for TAC setting up to 2017. However for 2018, the Commission proposals are not following these management plans. It should be noted that the sole plans are enshrined in legislation, while the Celtic Sea herring plan is not.</p> <p>In the longer term, the Commission intends to roll out new multi-annual plans for the various sea areas under its jurisdiction. These long term plans will contain a range of values for F<sub>MSY</sub> per stock, and in general follow the approach taken for the Baltic Sea multi-annual plan, which the EU adopted in 2016 for the main fish stocks. This plan was used as a basis for TAC setting for 2017. It was also used as a basis for ICES advice for 2018,though ambiguities in the plan made it difficult for ICES to identify the desired catch option. It is understood that similar ambiguities exist in the draft plan for North Sea demersal fish.</p> <p>3A. For stocks with data available to determine MSY proxies, the broad approach from the Commission will be to follow the advice from ICES in proposing TACs.</p> <p>3B. For stocks with survey-based trends or with advice based only on catch time series the approach would be to follow ICES, but on a case by case basis.</p> <p>3C. For the 26 stocks with TAC stability having been established on a multi-annual basis in 2013, the TAC proposals will follow previous ones unless there is special advise to do otherwise.</p> <p>3D. For stocks without biological advice it is not clear what the approach is for TAC setting. However the Commission is in liaison with ICES to develop suitable advisory products.</p> <p>4. For stocks coming under the Landing Obligation in 2018, and notwithstanding the provisions 1-3 above, TAC proposals will include uplift to accommodate hitherto legally discarded fish. However there is stated desire not to increase F or jeopardise the overall F<sub>MSY</sub> objective.</p> For certain by-catch stocks coming under the Landing Obligation, which would act as choke species, the Commission will consider removal of TAC control. This approach was already taken for North Sea dab and flounder in 2017. The Commission has announced its openness to such further proposals, if there is no risk to the conservation of the stock and if ICES advice is supportive.","<p>ICES advice is provided based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY).

The number of sustainably fished stocks has increased to 40 (over half the stocks evaluated; 53%). The percentage (21%) and number of stocks (16) overfished has increased by four compared to last year. The number of stocks with unknown status has decreased to 19 (25%).</p><p>Table 2 compares the state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points with the same evaluation presented in previous years.  The number of stocks that are above MSY biomass trigger points has increased to 36 (48%) and the number of stocks below MSY biomass trigger points has also increased to 15 (20%). The number of stocks with unknown biomass status has decreased to 24 (31%) this year.</p> <p>There are multiple reasons why stocks have unknown status including: short time series of biological data, conflicting input data, low catches and/or insufficient sampling data or missing catch information (e.g. angling catches or discards). Over time the percentage of stocks with unknown pressure and state indicators has declined. However, when ICES undertakes a benchmark and the assessment issues cannot be resolved occasionally stocks are downgraded and their status in relation to reference points becomes unknown. It is likely that for some stocks these will remain with unknown pressure or state category and the management and advisory framework should take this into account.</p><h3>Detailed analysis</h3><p>A detailed breakdown of the evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in previous Stock Books is presented in Table 3. Note that the stock status in a certain year may retrospectively be adjusted as more data become available. These adjustments are not included in Table 3; the table represents the data as it was reported at the time. The stock status of individual stocks varies over time but there is a clear overall trend, showing an increasing number of stocks fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> and with biomasses (SSB) above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> since 2012 (Figure 1).  This demonstrates a gradual progress towards long-term sustainable utilisation of the resource base.</p><p>The status of 23 stocks changed between the 2021 and 2022 assessments. These changes are highlighted in Table 4 and described below.</p><p>The status of F in relation to F<sub>MSY</sub> changed for 19 stocks. Six stocks which were assessed to be sustainably fished last year saw increases in fishing mortality above F<sub>MSY</sub> (Haddock 7b-k, Horse mackerel W, Mackerel NEA, <em>Nephrops</em> FU13, Plaice 7fg, Sole 7a). The two herring stocks (Herring 6aN, Herring 6aS,7bc) were split after a benchmark and both are now also assessed as sustainably fished.  Because F<sub>MSY</sub> is a target reference point, it is to be expected that a well-managed stock will fluctuate slightly around F<sub>MSY</sub>. Three stocks that were previously overfished are now exploited below F<sub>MSY</sub>  (Haddock 6b, Plaice 7hjk, Sole 7fg). The exploitation status for 6 stocks changed from unknown to sustainably exploited (Cuckoo ray 6,7,8abd, Porbeagle NEA, Spotted ray 6,7bj, Spotted ray 7ae-h, Thornback ray 7afg, Undulate ray 7de), while the exploitation status two stocks changed from unknown to over exploited (Anglerfish 3a,4,6 and Thornback ray 6).</p><p>The status of SSB in relation to the reference points changed for 16 stocks. One stocks is now considered to have recovered above the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (Spurdog NEA) while 10 stocks have changed to unknown biomass status to above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> or the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> proxy (Anglerfish 3a,4,6, Anglerfish (black) 7,8, Cuckoo ray 6,7,8abd, Plaice 7hjk, Small-eyed ray 7fg, Spotted ray 6,7bj, Spotted ray 7ae-h, Thornback ray 6, Thornback ray 7afg, Undulate ray 7de). One stock fell below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> proxy (Plaice 7fg) and two stocks changed to unknown biomass status to below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (Cod 7a, Porbeagle NEA).  The two herring stocks (Herring 6aN, Herring 6aS,7bc) were split after a benchmark and both have unknown status of SSB in relation to the reference points.

There are several different reasons why this may be the case: <ul><li> Some stocks are very relatively small and sampling is insufficient to support traditional assessment approaches e.g. Plaice and Sole in VIIbc, VIa, Pollock in VI.</li> <li> Some have uncertain assessment data for biological or stock identity/mixing reasons (e.g. megrim in VII, anglerfish in VII, Pollock in VII, Sprat, Plaice and Sole in VIIhjk)</li> <li> The absolute level of catch is an issue for stocks with high discards (e.g. Whiting in VIa and VIIa, Plaice in VIIa and VIIfg), where several species are landed together (e.g. rays) or where there are other catches (e.g. angling in the case of Pollock)</li> <li> For other stocks the time series of data is too short to properly define B<sub>trigger</sub> levels (e.g. <em><em>Nephrops</em></em> Stocks).</li></ul></p> <p>Over time the number of stocks with unknown status should decline but it is likely that for some stocks problems will remain and the management and advisory framework should take that into account.</p> <h4>Detailed analysis</h4> <p>A detailed breakdown of the Marine Institute evaluations of stock status in relation to sustainable fishing rates and biomass levels as given in the last four stock books presented in Table 1.4. The stock status as evaluated by ICES/ICCAT varies over time. The main changes between the 2014 and 2015 Stock Books are presented in Table 1.5. The main change of note is that following a benchmark Herring in VIaN has been merged with the Herring stock in VIIaS and VIIbc. This new stock is labelled as Herring VIaN, VIIaS and VIIbc which is the reason the number of stocks has declined from 73 to 72. The assessment on the merged stock also results in a change in status.</p> <p>Blue whiting, mackerel and <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em> in FU13 have been revised from being sustainably fished to being over exploited. Boarfish has been revised from being sustainably fished to having unknown status, while Whiting in the Irish Sea has gone from over exploited to unknown status. <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em> FU19, Sole VIIa and Western Horse mackerel IIa IVa VI VIIa-c,e-k VIII are now classified as sustainably fished . Celtic Sea cod has decreased below the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>. New MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> values have been defined for <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em> FU14 and FU17 and Whiting in VIa following benchmark assessments at ICES. Haddock VIb and Herring in the NE Atlantic I II have increased above MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>.</p>"

This is characterised by a greatly reduced spawning stock, a decreasing proportion of older fish in the catch, and generally very low recruitment year after year.<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">SACs</span> Special Areas of Conservation, sites designated under the European Community Habitats Directive, to protect internationally important natural habitats and species.<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Sample</span> A proportion or a segment of a fish stock which is removed for study, and is assumed to be representative of the whole. The greater the effort, in terms of both numbers and magnitude of the samples, the greater the confidence that the information obtained is a true reflection of the status of a stock (level of abundance in terms of numbers or weight, age composition, etc.)<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Shellfish Fisheries</span> Those fisheries were the target species are either crustaceans (e.g. <em><em><em>Nephrops</em></em></em>, lobsters, crabs and crayfish) or molluscs (Cephalopods, scallops, oysters etc.). <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">SSB / Spawning Stock Biomass</span> The total weight of all sexually mature fish in the population. The size of SSB for a stock depends on abundance of year classes, the exploitation pattern, the rate of growth, fishing and natural mortality rates, the onset of sexual maturity and environmental conditions. <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">SSB<sub>MP</sub></span> Spawning stock biomass reference point as defined in management plans. <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">SSB/R / S/R</span> Spawning Stock Biomass per Recruit: expected lifetime contribution to the spawning stock biomass for a recruit of a specific age (e.g., per age 2 individual). For a given exploitation pattern, rate of growth, and natural mortality, an expected equilibrium value of SSB/R can be calculated for each level of fishing mortality. <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Spawning stock biomass-per-recruit (SSB/R)</span> The expected lifetime contribution to the spawning stock biomass for a recruit of a specific age (e.g., per age 2 individual). For a given exploitation pattern, rate of growth, and natural mortality, an expected equilibrium value of SSB/R can be calculated for each level of F. A useful reference point is the level of SSB/R that would be realised if there were no fishing. This is a maximum value for SSB/R, and can be compared to levels of SSB/R generated under different rates of fishing. For example, the maximum SSB/R for Georges Bank haddock is approximately 9 kg for a recruit at age 1.<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">STECF</span> The Scientific Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries. Established by the European Commission and comprises fisheries scientists and economists from the member states. The role of STECF is to advise the European Commission on scientific, technical and economic issues related to the management of fisheries resources that are exploited worldwide by members of the European Union. (see <a href=""https://stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu/"" target=""_blank"".>www.stecf.jrc.ec.europa.eu</a>) <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Stock</span> A ''stock'' is a population of a species living in a defined geographical area with similar biological parameters (e.g. growth, size at maturity, fecundity etc.) and a shared mortality rate. A thorough understanding of the fisheries biology of any species is needed to define these biological parameters. <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Stocklettes</span> Is a small localised population of a species living in a defined geographical area that mixes with other populations at a meta-population level perhaps during breeding phase of the life-cycle but may have different biological parameters and mortality rates.<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Stratification</span> When water masses with different properties e.g. salinity, density or temperature form layers that act as barriers to water mixing. The least dense water masses sit above the more dense layers. Stratification creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers and can affect primary production by limiting photosynthetic processes.<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Sublittoral zone</span> An area that is permanently submerged and spans from the low tide mark to the edge of the continental shelf. <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Sustainable yield</span> The number or weight of fish in a stock that can be taken by fishing without reducing the stock biomass from year to year, assuming that environmental conditions remain the same<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">TAC / Total Allowable Catch</span> is the total regulated catch from a stock in a given time period, usually a year<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Tangle nets</span> Static nets lain on the bottom of the sea, aimed at trapping fish and shellfish by entanglement in their meshes<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Teleost</span> Type of fish - such as cod, mackerel, plaice and sole - have skeletons made of bone, as opposed to elasmobranches - such as sharks and rays - whose skeleton is composed of cartilage<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">TCM / Technical Conservation Measures</span> These measures take the form of closed areas, increased mesh sizes and gear modifications (such as separator panels) and are aimed at protecting specific stocks, or age-classes within that stock, from overfishing (See also Recovery Plans)<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">U</span> An index of exploitable biomass<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">U<sub>lim</sub></span> For deepwater stocks has been calculated as 0.2 * Umax (may be a smoothed abundance index)<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">U<sub>pa</sub></span> For deepwater stocks has been calculated as 0.5 * Umax. For redfish Upa = 0.6 * Umax<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Unaccounted mortality</span> Any mortality that is not accounted for properly in a stock assessment model. Potential causes of unaccounted mortality include illegal or misreported landings; escapement or avoidance mortality that occurs when fish are injured by fishing gear but are not captured; and ghost fishing mortality, caused by lost gear (e.g., traps and gillnets) that continues to catch fish<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Unaccounted removals</span> Any removal that are not accounted for properly in a stock assessment model. Potential causes include unaccounted mortality, migrations changes in natural mortality due to starvation, competition, predation, disease or mass mortality events<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Uplift</span> Before the introduction of the landing obligation, TACs generally applied to landings only. As the landing obligation is being phased in, the TAC will apply to the catch instead. Uplift is the increase in TAC that covers the proportion of the catches that were formerly discarded<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Upwelling</span> Wind-driven motion of dense, cool, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-depleted surface water<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">VPA</span> Virtual Population Analysis. An algorithm for computing historical fishing mortality rates and stock sizes by age, based on data on catches, natural mortality, and certain assumptions about mortality for the last year and last age group. A VPA essentially reconstructs the history of each cohort, assuming that the observed catches are known without error (Powers & Restrepo, 1992). VPA is often used as a generic description of an age-based stock assessment but this is not necessarily true because many stock assessments are based on different (statistical) assumptions<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">Whitefish</span> Term used to describe demersal species such as cod, plaice, ray etc., as opposed to pelagic or salmonid species<p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">WWF</span> World Wide Fund for Nature - The Conservation Organization (known as World Wildlife Fund in certain countries). <p><span style=""color:#EB6864"">WWWMAP</span> Proposal for Multiannual plan for fish stocks in the Western Waters and adjacent waters.

LongTermManagement plans,"<p>Several of the stocks of interest to Ireland are or have been managed under Long Term Management plans. Details on these plans are given in the table below. Normally the process of formulation and adoption of these plans has required scientific input to generate and test a harvest control rule (HCR) which is used as part of the setting TAC procedure. These plans are normally proposed by the competent management authority (e.g. European Commission and/or coastal states), tested for adherence to the precautionary approach and maximum sustainable yield by ICES and then could be adopted by the management authorities. </p> <p> Since 2016 the Commission has developed multiannual sea basin plans for demersal species caught together in multi species fisheries. The sea basin plans have been adopted already for the Baltic Sea (2016/1193), and the North Sea (2016/0238), and in 2019 for the Atlantic area which is referred to as Western Waters (2019/472). These plans are commonly referred to as Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). The stocks included in the Western Waters MAP and those in the North Sea MAP of relevance to Ireland are given in the Appendix IX document below (scroll down this page). The MAPs set out to achieve the objectives of the CFP, facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation and promote a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities. Because ICES gives advice in the context of the policies of several clients, ICES only gives headline MAP advice for stocks that are fished by the EU only. Since the majority of western waters stocks are fished with the UK, the MAP is only used as the headline advice for a handful of stocks, while catch scenarios are provided in the table below, consistent with the MSY ranges. </p><p> It should be noted that ICES also applies an advice rule when stock fall below a MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point. This implies that the F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are scaled when the SSB is below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (by SSB/MSYB<sub>trigger</sub>). It should also be noted that when no F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are available ICES defaults to a PA approach for the advice. This is the case for several target stocks in the MAPs such as pollack and anglerfish in areas 4 & 6. </p> <p>The applicable advice basis is dependent on the following series of points:<ul><li> Is the stock listed in an EU MAP and not fished by other countries? </li> <li> Is there a range (upper and lower values) defined for the stock? </li> <li> In the assessment of the stock, is spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point? </li> <li> Is the SSB above the B<sub>lim</sub> reference point? </li> <li> If there is no catch option to bring SSB above B<sub>lim</sub> in the catch advice year, zero catch advice is given. </li></ul></p>","<p>Several of the stocks of interest to Ireland are or have been managed under Long Term Management plans.

The sea basin plans have been adopted already for the Baltic Sea (2016/1193), and the North Sea (2016/0238), and in 2019 for the Atlantic area which is referred to as Western Waters (2019/472). These plans are commonly referred to as Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs).</p> <p>The MAPs set out to achieve the objectives of the CFP, facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation and promote a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities. They were drafted to be coherent with the MSFD (2008/56), and the Birds Directive (2009/147). Unlike previous management plans which laid out a TAC setting rule, the principle of the MAPs is to implement the MSY policy adopted under the CFP, following best scientific advice. This is done whilst having due regard to the fact that many species are caught together, and that some of the species caught by the fisheries are not targeted but by-catches. Implementing the principles has meant: that target stocks are identified under the plans (stocks not listed as target are implicitly considered as bycatches); that TACs are set on target stocks within a range about F<sub>MSY</sub>, but the upper part of the range can only be used under the conditions set out in the MAPs. Non target by-catches are managed not to optimise yield but to prevent harm in the context of the Precautionary Approach. Because ICES gives advice in the context of the policies of several clients, ICES only gives headline MAP advice for stocks that are fished by the EU only. The framework for providing advice is given below. It should be noted that ICES also applies an advice rule when stock fall below a MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point. This implies that the F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are scaled when the SSB is below MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> (by SSB/MSYB<sub>trigger</sub>).

The sea basin plans have been adopted already for the Baltic Sea (2016/1193), and the North Sea (2016/0238), and in 2019 for the Atlantic area which is referred to as Western Waters (2019/472). These plans are commonly referred to as Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). </p> <p>The MAPs set out to achieve the objectives of the CFP, facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation and promote a fair standard of living for those who depend on fishing activities. They were drafted to be coherent with the MSFD (2008/56), and the Birds Directive (2009/147). Unlike previous management plans which laid out a TAC setting rule, the principle of the MAPs is to implement the MSY policy adopted under the CFP, following best scientific advice. This is done whilst having due regard to the fact that many species are caught together, and that some of the species caught by the fisheries are not targeted but by-catches. Implementing the principles has meant: that target species are identified under the plans (species not listed as target are implicitly considered as bycatches); that TACs are set on target species within a range about F<sub>MSY</sub>, but the upper part of the range can only be used under the conditions set out in the MAPs. Non target by-catches are managed not to optimise yield but to prevent harm in the context of the Precautionary Approach. </p> <p>Because ICES gives advice in the context of the policies of its clients, ICES advice for many demersal stocks of interest to Ireland are now given in the context of the Western Waters MAP. The framework for providing advice is given below. It should be noted that ICES also applies an advice rule when stock fall below a MSY B<sub>trigger</sub> reference point. This implies that the F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are scaled when the SSB is below MSYB<sub>trigger</sub> (by SSB/MSYB<sub>trigger</sub>). It should also be noted that when no F<sub>MSY</sub> reference points are available ICES defaults to a PA approach for the advice. This is the case for several target stocks in the MAPs such as Pollock.</p> <p>The applicable advice basis is dependent on the following series of points: <ul><li> Is the stock listed in an EU MAP <li> Is there a range (upper and lower values) defined for the stock <li> In the assessment of the stock, is spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the MSYB<sub>trigger</sub> reference point <li> Is the SSB above the B<sub>lim</sub> reference point <li> If there is no catch option to bring SSB above B<sub>lim</sub> in the catch advice year, zero catch advice is given.</li></ul> </p>","<p>Several of the stocks of interest to Ireland are or have been managed under Long Term Management plans.
