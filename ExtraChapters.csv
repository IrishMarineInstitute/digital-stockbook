Brexit_Text,"<H3>BREXIT IMPACTS ON FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, SCIENCE AND ADVICE</H3>
<p>On 1 January 2021 the UK left the EU. This had implications for Irish fisheries in terms of quota shares and access to UK waters. The UK's departure from the EU did not affect the ICES stock assessment process. </p>
<h3>Fisheries management </h3>
<p>In terms of fisheries management, the UK is now an independent 'Coastal State' that shares fisheries resources with the EU, similar to countries like Norway but with a much larger number of shared stocks. </p>
<p>The Trade and Cooperation Agreement<a href=""#footnote-1"">[1]</a> sets out the arrangements between the UK and EU on large number of areas, including fisheries. The agreement sets out changes to the TAC shares: the UK negotiated an increased share of the TAC for 61 stocks. This results in a commensurate reduction in the EU (and therefore Irish) share. For most stocks a transition period applies where 60% of the transition to the new shares occurred in 2021, to be followed by 70% in 2022, 80% in 2023 and 92% in 2024. By 2025, the transition to the new TAC shares will be complete. DAFM published a document<a href=""#footnote-2"">[2]</a> which outlines how the Irish shares of the TAC will change during the transition period.</p>
<p>Fishing opportunities (TACs) for EU stocks were historically established at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in December. Following the new agreement between the EU and the UK, TACs for the stocks which are jointly managed by the two parties are now established through annual consultations between both parties.  </p>
<p>The agreement also includes a licensing system for fishing vessels through which reciprocal access to each other's waters is granted. However, the detail of access is to be negotiated trough annual consultations. </p>
<h3>Science and advice </h3>
<p>The EU and UK have agreed to ensure that fishing activities for shared stocks are sustainably managed in line with the best available scientific advice.  The parties also agreed to ensure the continued collection and sharing of data relevant to stock assessment and fisheries management.</p>
<p>ICES membership is not limited to EU countries and the UK remains a full member of ICES. The UK's contribution to stock assessment working groups in terms of data and scientists has not changed. In terms of ICES catch advice, the only change is the way the 'headline' catch advice is formulated. In previous years, this advice was based on the EU Multi-Annual Plans<a href=""#footnote-3"">[3]</a> (EU MAPs) for stocks covered by these plans. Under the EU MAPs, TACs are set within a range around F<sub>MSY</sub> to allow increased flexibility in the management of these stocks. The ICES headline catch advice therefore included these ranges, where applicable. The EU MAPs no longer apply to the UK so for shared EU-UK stocks, the ICES headline advice no longer includes the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges but only the F<sub>MSY</sub> advice. However, the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges are still available in the catch options table of the relevant stocks. </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p id=""footnote-1"">[1]<a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/relations-non-eu-countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-andcooperation-
