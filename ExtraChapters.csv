Recent_Beginning,"<h3>RECENT ADVICE ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND EFFECTS 2023 TEST</h3>
<p>In addition to the fisheries advice ICES provides a range of recurrent and non-recurrent Advice on Ecosystem Services and Effects (<a href=""https://ices-library.figshare.com/articles/report/Advice_on_ecosystem_services_and_effects/19551433"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2022</a> ).  This advice is developed according to ICES procedures and approved by the Advisory Committee (ACOM) and follows the ICES Advisory framework and principles (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.7648"" target=""_blank"">ICES, 2021</a> ).  The most up to date ICES advice is available here:  <a href=""https://www.ices.dk/advice/Pages/Latest-Advice.aspx"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ices.dk/advice/Pages/Latest-Advice.aspx</a> . A summary of the advice most relevant to Ireland issued by ICES in 2022 is provided below (See links below): </p><h3>EU - Lists for Descriptor 3 (commercially exploited fish and shellfish) reporting by EU Member States under MSFD Article 17 in 2024</h3><p>ICES developed regional lists of commercially relevant taxa for each MSFD (sub)region. The lists are based on landing weights and values aggregated from FDI landings data 2015-2020 from EU Member States and include UK landing statistics.  ICES advises that EU Member States report for Descriptor 3 (D3) on all taxa provided, for their MSFD (sub)regions to support regional coherence within MSFD (sub)regions. ICES notes that reporting does not necessarily require an assessment of GES. The total number of landed taxa within each MSFD (sub)region should be taken into account when setting regional thresholds for the selection of relevant D3 taxa. The regional lists presented here include the relevant widely distributed species for the MSFD (sub)regions; no further criterion is required for this species group. The D3 taxa lists should be updated for each MSFD assessment cycle.</p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21332967 "" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21332967 </a> </p><h3>EU request to advise on methods for assessing adverse effects on seabed habitats</h3><p>ICES advises on the suitability and shortcomings of different indicators and indicator methods for assessments of adverse effects on seabed habitats. The indicators are specifically evaluated for MSFD D6C3 and D6C5 assessments of (sub)regions and broad habitat types (BHTs). Performance is evaluated in gradient studies or relative performance ranking. Suitability is evaluated in terms of associated habitat properties, output type and scale, and potential use for setting ecologically-meaningful and quantitative thresholds.</p><p>Regional assessments would ultimately best be carried out by applying different indicators in a complementary manner. Systematic screening of indicators that cover different aspects of seabed habitat condition and benthic community properties may improve change detection as well as accuracy and confidence in assessments of human pressures. State-based and pressure-based assessment methods would be best implemented simultaneously, sequentially and/or iteratively to maximize operationality across regional, national, and local scales. </p><p>ICES was unable to estimate and advise on robust quality threshold values. Appropriate thresholds for seabed habitat need to be relevant to the management aims (achieving GES), informed by ecological principles, and be ecologically meaningful, habitat-specific, and preferably derived from the objective analysis of ecological data, with uncertainty estimation. ICES advises on the main components of a framework and a stepwise approach to evaluating methods that assess the state of seabed habitats and the effects of human pressures.</p><p>Current sampling effort and design is unlikely to provide an empirically-based, representative picture of seabed habitat status (state-based indicators) at the whole regional scale required for MSFD/D6 assessments. Guidance should be developed for strategic sampling that will facilitate data standardisation between countries and ensure ground-truthing of analytical assessment outcomes (from pressure-based methods) in areas of extrapolations with high uncertainty. </p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21674084"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21674084</a></p><h3>Bycatch of protected, endangered, and/or threatened species of marine mammals, seabirds and marine turtles, and selected fish species of bycatch relevance</h3><p>ICES summarizes new bycatch information on marine mammals, seabirds, marine turtles, and fish in 2021, based on reported bycatch data received through the ICES data call.</p><p>ICES reiterates that current bycatch monitoring activities and sampling design in most cases do not yet allow for robust and unbiased estimations of numbers of sensitive species caught incidentally in fishing activities.</p><p>In the absence of estimations of absolute numbers, multiannual average bycatch rates are used to highlight species, metiers, and ecoregions where bycatch may be of particular concern. This information can be used to prioritize species or fishing metiers for monitoring and management measures. In 2017-2021, the highest bycatch rates for mammals were observed for harbour seals and harbour porpoises in set gillnets in the Icelandic Waters ecoregion, for grey seals in set gillnets in the Celtic Seas ecoregion, and for common dolphin in pair trawls in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast ecoregion. For seabirds, the highest bycatch rates were observed for common guillemot and northern fulmar in set gillnets and longlines in the Icelandic Waters ecoregion and northern fulmar in longlines in the Greater North Sea ecoregion. From the three turtle species reported, the highest bycatch rates were found for the loggerhead sea turtles caught by drifting longline fisheries in the Azores ecoregion and in the Adriatic Sea.</p><p>ICES advises on other species and areas of bycatch concern which are currently not well represented in the bycatch monitoring data due to their rarity, including species with evidence of low or declining abundance and/or high susceptibility to bycatch. This includes the Baltic Proper subpopulation of harbour porpoise in the Baltic Sea ecoregion, the leatherback turtle subpopulation in the Oceanic Northeast Atlantic, Azores, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast ecoregions, and the Balearic shearwater in the Western Mediterranean Sea and the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast ecoregion. It also includes several fish species, namely the European sturgeon in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast and Greater North Sea ecoregions; Atlantic sturgeon in the Baltic Sea ecoregion; common blue skate/flapper skate in the Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, and Celtic Seas ecoregions; angel shark in the Celtic Seas ecoregion; basking shark in the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast ecoregions; and great white shark in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast ecoregions and in the Western and Central Mediterranean Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea, and Aegean-Levantine Sea.</p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21695375"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21695375</a></p><h4>Bycatch of protected, endangered, and threatened species in the Celtic Sea Fisheries Overview</h4><p>All fisheries have the potential to catch protected, endangered, or threatened species, such as seabirds and marine mammals, as non-targeted bycatch. Data submitted to ICES through annual data calls indicated that between 2017-2021 nine ICES Member Countries had fisheries operating in the Celtic Seas ecoregion (ICES, 2022a). During the same period approximately 10 000 monitoring days were undertaken, primarily by at-sea observers, in a variety of static and mobile gears and on vessels ranging from under 8 m to over 40 m. Most bycatch data collection in the ecoregion is carried out within multipurpose programmes under the DCF and through dedicated bycatch monitoring programmes.</p><h4>Bycatch records in 2021</h4><p>Data submitted to ICES for 2021 indicated that approximately 1400 monitoring days were undertaken in the ecoregion that year. Data were provided by all nine countries with fisheries operating in the area and were collected by three methods: at-sea observers (49% of monitored days), vessel crew observers (45%) and logbooks (6%).</p><p>In 2021, 68 marine mammals from at least four species were recorded as bycatch, mostly in net metiers (Table 1). Twelve seabirds from at least four species were recorded bycaught in bottom trawl, longline, purse seine and net fisheries. Over 118 000 specimens of fish of potential conservation interest were recorded from a wide mix of static and mobile gears. Most of the fish records were of blackbelly rosefish/bluemouth rockfish in bottom trawls. No turtles were reported as bycatch. </p><h4>Multiannual bycatch rates</h4><p>Highest bycatch rates (pooled data 2017-2021) were observed for grey seal and harbour seal in set gillnets (GNS) and trammel nets (GTR; Figure 17). Common dolphin bycatch was recorded in several metiers (GNS, GTR, OTB, OTT, and PTM). Long-finned pilot whale and grey seal were recorded in midwater otter trawls (OTM). Harbour porpoise were recorded in gillnets and otter trawls (GNS, OTB, OTT).</p><p>The highest seabird bycatch rates (pooled data 2017-2021) were observed in set longlines (LLS), where northern fulmar and northern gannet had the highest reported bycatch rate (Figure 18). Guillemots were reported in set gillnets (GNS). Low rates of seabird bycatch was observed in some trawl metiers (OTB, OTT, and PTM). </p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21641312"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.21641312</a></p>

Recent_End,,"<h3>Celtic Seas ecoregion - Aquaculture Overview</h3><p>Following the publication of an Aquaculture Overview for the Norwegian Sea Ecoregion in 2021, ICES has recently published the Celtic Seas Aquaculture Overview, providing up to date information on aquaculture activities and science within the eco-region. </p><p>Total aquaculture production in the ecoregion in 2018 represents 21% of the overall aquaculture production in Europe by volume and 34% by value. Total production increased from 1950 up to 2004 but has since then stabilized fluctuating around 240,000 tonnes annually. Marine aquaculture production within the ecoregion is currently strongly dominated by Atlantic salmon (> 80% of the total production by volume), largely produced in Scotland. Shellfish aquaculture predominates in terms of the number of licensed sites and enterprises. Production volumes of other invertebrates and seaweeds are relatively small.</p><p>Major changes have occurred in the average price per tonne for some important cultured taxa in the last decade: mussel prices have decreased by approximately 49% while Pacific oyster prices have increased by approximately 31%. Small production units (fewer than five employees) predominate in all jurisdictions although larger, more capital-intensive operations characterize the finfish sector and are also increasing in the mussel sector. Employment status is more stable for the finfish sector than the shellfish sector. The aquaculture sector has a high socio-economic importance in rural coastal communities.</p><p>The primary environmental interactions relate to habitats and species. Sea lice and genetic introgression from farmed salmon are considered as the main aquaculture threats to wild salmon populations. Other important environmental interactions considered include disease transmissions, emissions of dissolved nutrients, particulate organic matter, pollutants, and therapeutants. Increased species richness, diversity, and abundance of sessile and mobile organisms relative to ambient conditions have been observed nearby some mussel farms. The introduction of several non-indigenous invertebrate species (carpet sea squirt, leathery sea squirt, slipper limpet, Asian shore crab, Chinese mitten crab) has also been directly linked to shellfish aquaculture. In response, the British-Irish Council has established an <em>Invasive Non-Native Species</em> subgroup to develop aquaculture biosecurity protocols for these species. </p><p>Sustainable aquaculture growth is a vital element for future global and regional food security in addition to the socio-economic development of rural areas within the ecoregion. Innovative developments include the diversification of existing culture systems in response to changing environmental or biological drivers, application of diverse and innovative delousing techniques, expansion of seaweed aquaculture, diversification of fish culture species other than salmonids, and development of offshore and recirculation aquaculture technologies.</p><p>Future aquaculture development and management should increasingly consider interactions with other human activities, such as wild capture fisheries, recreation/tourism, offshore renewables, and the designation of marine protected areas. Climate change can further hamper sustainable growth and existing capacity for aquaculture in the ecoregion due to elevated temperatures affecting productivity, altering disease outbreaks and increasing the risk of harmful algal blooms. An increase in the frequency of extreme weather conditions may impact on safety and increase the risk of damage and escapes.</p>

Brexit_Text,<h3>This is the 2023 test</h3>,This is the 2022 test,,,,,
AtSea_Text,"<h3>Marine Institute At-Sea Sampling</h3><p>Since the relaxing of Covid-19 restrictions the Marine Institute has been rebuilding and reinstating the sampling program both at sea and on land. The successful At-Sea-Self-Sampling, a Covid mitigation measure developed in conjunction with industry, has been continued and expanded to compliment the Sampler at Sea program where MI trained samplers sample at sea on commercial fishing trips resulting in a dual stream approach to sampling at sea. Comparative analysis of the at sea self-sampling and the sampler at sea data has shown that the whilst the self-sampling does not have the same resolution as the sampler at sea it is an effective support to the program and helps to increase the sampling rate. This dual stream approach allows vessels to participate in the sampling at sea program even where accommodation for a sampler may be limiting. Both streams of data require the goodwill and co-operation of the vessel, skipper and crew to successfully implement the high standards of data collection and quality control to feed into the assessment process. Due to various extraneous circumstances 2022 was a difficult year for sampling at sea and despite the dual stream approach resulted the lowest number of trips to date for the sampling at sea program, particularly with the demersal fleet. The Marine Institute has been working closely with the Producers Organisation, the Fishery Improvement Projects (FIPs) and the fishermen's co-ops to rebuild the programme from this historic low.</p><p>Working with the department (DAFM) the MI has increased sampling in the Porcupine <em>Nephrops</em> FU16 fishery with specific sampling requirements associated with the limited authorised summer fishery where four vessels per month fished FU16 in Jun, July, Aug. Each vessel participating in the summer fishery sampled either by At-Sea-Self-Sampling or via a sampler sailing with them. The data collected during this period will be analysed and compared with data collected in the rest of the year. Preliminary analysis confirms the previously reported fact that overigerous and soft females are more prevalent on the ground during these months.</p><p>The At-Sea-Self-Sampling has also been modified and tailored to expand into the pelagic fleet. Initial trials of the Pelagic At-Sea-Self-Sampling in the first quarter proved successful and whilst working with the fleet and the Irish Tuna FIP was rolled out to the majority of vessels participating in the Bay of Biscay albacore fishery. The Pelagic At-Sea-Self-Sampling greatly increased the number of observations with the majority of fishing operations sampled by either the self-sampling or by our sampler at sea during what turned out to be a longer season than expected. Data from the dual sampled fishery confirms what was historically reported, (from a relatively low sampling rate of previous years) - that the incident of bycatch of birds, mammals & reptiles from this fishery is near zero. The recording of rare events such as by-catch interactions requires a high level of sampling to ensure that the most accurate data is reported.</p><p>Inshore sampling at sea also employs a dual sampling approach to support the data acquisition from a large number of vessels around the coast. Whilst sessile stocks such as razorfish, oysters and cockles are mainly assessed via dedicated surveys the data collected at sea during fishing operations is of critical importance to the assessment of many inshore species. Data such as catch per unit effort collected via the self-sampled and sentinel fleet is supported by data collected by samplers at sea.</p><p>As the Marine Institute builds and expands the dual stream approach to at-sea sampling it is important to note that the utility of both streams is dependent on the quality and quantity of the other. It is hoped that the fleet will continue to embrace this dual stream approach and help increase the quantity and quality of data from the deck to the input into the assessment process.</p>
","<h3>Marine Institute At-Sea Sampling 2021 - including COVID-19 Response</h3><p>From March 2020 the Marine Institute (MI) at sea sampling aboard commercial vessels was temporarily suspended in the interest of the health and safety of both samplers and the fishing crews due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This temporary suspension remained in place for 2021 and therefore the MI have not had samplers at sea on commercial trips >18 hours during much of 2022 although normal sampling has resumed in the latter half of 2022. The MI were able to sample at sea on inshore vessels where overnight accommodation is not a requirement and sampling occurs outside on deck resulting in a number of at-sea trips. In 2022 the availability of vessels was reduced with a significant number availing of the tie-up schemes introduced after Brexit.</p>
<p>To mitigate for the loss of at sea sampler coverage the Marine Institute (MI) has worked with the industry and continued the at-sea self-sampling programme developed in 2020 where the skippers/crews collect data and samples from a subset of the hauls, bring the material ashore where MI staff measure and work up under COVID-19 guidelines. Each vessel is contacted individually by the Fisheries Liaison Team Leader (TL) following ""4s sampling""  guidelines selection in advance of a possible trip. On agreeing to participate the skipper is trained via remote training and supplied with a sampling pack pre sailing. Participating skippers record data on haul start & stop positions, date and time, estimate the bulk catch, record observations on bird, mammal, reptile interaction record by kg /species what catch is wanted and take one random box of unwanted catch for measurement ashore by our staff.  On sailing the participating skipper maintains contact with the Fisheries Liaison (TL) and quality assurance checks are performed regularly during the trip via WhatsApp. The extra samples coming ashore has resulted in an increased resource requirement ashore which is offset by the pandemic imposed lack of sea time. This mitigation measure has ensured that MI kept catch data flowing to our process systems and more importantly ensured that the dialogue between the MI and the industry is maintained and developed. This has resulted in over sixty demersal trips, 13 pelagic trips and 212 inshore/shellfish trips (inshore/shellfish is a combination of at sea sampler and self-sampling) sampled in 2021. </p><p>In 2020 the Marine Institute established up a self-sampling project with the Irish Tuna Fishery Improvement Project FIP (<a href=""http://www.irishtunafip.ie/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.irishtunafip.ie/</a>) where the Irish tuna fleet employed a crew member to self-sample data during the albacore fishery working to MI standard operating procedures. The crew member was trained by the MI and delivered the data to MI for entry/analysis. This program was continued in 2021 - 3 trips were sampled in in the Bay of Biscay during the season. The MI FU16 at-sea self-sampling programme to sample Porcupine <em>Nephrops</em> was continued and expanded in 2021 yielding 10 trips and associated samples.</p>
<p>The at-sea self-sampling programme was assessed and has resulted in several positive benefits; close collaboration and frequent communication with active fishermen, developing new self-sampling protocols, recruiting new vessels to the programme (including vessels with limited accommodation), increased understanding of the importance of scientific data collection and specific standards/SOPs. The MI aims to build on the partnerships developed with the industry through the at-sea self-sampling programme. In the future it is expected that the at-sea programme will take the form of dual streams for the collection of fisheries dependant data 1) from self-sampling and 2) from scientific samplers aboard vessels.</p>
