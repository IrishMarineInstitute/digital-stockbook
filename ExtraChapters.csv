<p>In addition to the fisheries advice ICES provides are range of recurrent and non-recurrent Advice on Ecosystem Services and Effects (ICES, 2021).  This advice is developed according to ICES procedures and approved by the Advisory Committee (ACOM) and follows the ICES Advisory framework and principles (ICES, 2021).

A summary of the advice most relevant to Ireland issued by ICES in 2021 is provided below (See links below): </p><h3>EU - How management scenarios to reduce mobile bottom fishing disturbance on seafloor habitats affect fisheries landing and value </h3><p>ICES explored five management scenarios that could be used to reduce pressure and impact on the seabed caused by bottom trawling and modelled the consequences of their implementation for bottom trawling by vessels greater than 12 m. In this advice, and the accompanying four regional assessments and interactive maps, ICES uses two impact and one pressure (presence or absence of bottom trawling) indicators to describe these consequences. ICES advises that bottom trawling is the main physical pressure exerted on the seabed across the EU's marine waters. It is spatially aggregated to form core areas where bottom trawling effort and value of catch is high and larger peripheral fishing areas where effort and value of catch is low. This general pattern is found for all mtiers and in all regions. ICES advises that some levels of bottom trawl fishing can be compatible with achieving seabed conservation objectives. However, a prerequisite for evaluating these objectives will be to define ecologically meaningful limits beyond which continued bottom trawl fishing will have adverse effects. These limits can inform the setting of Good Environmental Status (GES) thresholds for quality and areal extent. ICES presents management scenarios that balance the economics of bottom trawling with the protection of MSFD broad habitat types by ensuring trawling continues to be concentrated in highly trawled core grounds that are already impacted and reduced in peripheral grounds that are lightly trawled. For example, the results show that collectively for the Baltic Sea, Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas,  and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, the removal of less than 10% of the total bottom trawling effort from peripheral fishing grounds will increase the overall extent of untrawled area to more than 40% in each MSFD broad habitat type in each subdivision.</p>","( indicates an average SAR >10,  indicates an average SAR 5-10,  indicates an average SAR 1-5, indicates an average SAR 0.5-1,  indicates an average SAR 0.1-0.5).

(EU)2016/2336)</h3>
There are two parts to ICES advice:
<ol><li>ICES advises that the Existing Deep-Sea Fishing Areas"" for the reference years 2009-2011 are based on the VMS and logbook data submitted to ICES in 2019 and shown in the accompanying Interactive Maps and PDF maps. The coordinates are provided in CSV files. ""Existing Deep-Sea Fishing Areas"" for the reference years are limited to the 400-800 metre depth range and are separated into three fishing footprints based on the gear type used. These are the combined static and mobile bottom-contacting gear (MBCG) footprint,  the static gear only footprint,  and the MBCG only footprint.</li><li> ICES advises that the list of areas where VMEs are known to occur or likely to occur is based on the VME data submitted to ICES in 2020. These areas are shown in the accompanying interactive maps. The coordinates are provided in CSV files. The list of habitat types, indicators, and physical elements used to define these VME areas is provided, along with the criteria used to translate the quantity and quality of data into the likelihood of VME occurrence,  known as a VME Index. </li></ol><p>This data-driven advice was developed through an iterative three-year process and is modelled on the approach taken by ""NEAFC Recommendation 19- 2014: Protection of VMEs in NEAFC Regulatory Areas"". It involves combining two data streams, VMS/logbook data to quantify the fishing footprint and data on where VMEs are known to or are likely to occur. To demonstrate how these two data layers can be used in practice to protect VMEs from fishing impacts, ICES developed and describes two scenarios, each with two options; ICES considers these to be consistent with the relevant United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Sustainable Fisheries Resolutions and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas with regard to the protection of VMEs. The two scenarios place different emphasis on the dual aspects of the UNGA policy and EU Regulation 2016/2336,  that is,  protection of VMEs with and without consideration of bottom-contacting fishing activity.",,,,,
Recent_End,"<h3>Celtic Seas ecoregion - Aquaculture Overview</h3><p>Following the publication of an Aquaculture Overview for the Norwegian Sea Ecoregion in 2021, ICES has recently published the Celtic Seas Aquaculture Overview, providing up to date information on aquaculture activities and science within the eco-region. </p><p>Total aquaculture production in the ecoregion in 2018 represents 21% of the overall aquaculture production in Europe by volume and 34% by value. Total production increased from 1950 up to 2004 but has since then stabilized fluctuating around 240,000 tonnes annually. Marine aquaculture production within the ecoregion is currently strongly dominated by Atlantic salmon (> 80% of the total production by volume), largely produced in Scotland. Shellfish aquaculture predominates in terms of the number of licensed sites and enterprises. Production volumes of other invertebrates and seaweeds are relatively small.</p><p>Major changes have occurred in the average price per tonne for some important cultured taxa in the last decade: mussel prices have decreased by approximately 49% while Pacific oyster prices have increased by approximately 31%. Small production units (fewer than five employees) predominate in all jurisdictions although larger, more capital-intensive operations characterize the finfish sector and are also increasing in the mussel sector. Employment status is more stable for the finfish sector than the shellfish sector. The aquaculture sector has a high socio-economic importance in rural coastal communities.</p><p>The primary environmental interactions relate to habitats and species. Sea lice and genetic introgression from farmed salmon are considered as the main aquaculture threats to wild salmon populations. Other important environmental interactions considered include disease transmissions, emissions of dissolved nutrients, particulate organic matter, pollutants, and therapeutants. Increased species richness, diversity, and abundance of sessile and mobile organisms relative to ambient conditions have been observed nearby some mussel farms. The introduction of several non-indigenous invertebrate species (carpet sea squirt, leathery sea squirt, slipper limpet, Asian shore crab, Chinese mitten crab) has also been directly linked to shellfish aquaculture. In response, the British-Irish Council has established an Invasive Non-Native Species subgroup to develop aquaculture biosecurity protocols for these species. </p><p>Sustainable aquaculture growth is a vital element for future global and regional food security in addition to the socio-economic development of rural areas within the ecoregion. Innovative developments include the diversification of existing culture systems in response to changing environmental or biological drivers, application of diverse and innovative delousing techniques, expansion of seaweed aquaculture, diversification of fish culture species other than salmonids, and development of offshore and recirculation aquaculture technologies.</p><p>Future aquaculture development and management should increasingly consider interactions with other human activities, such as wild capture fisheries, recreation/tourism, offshore renewables, and the designation of marine protected areas. Climate change can further hamper sustainable growth and existing capacity for aquaculture in the ecoregion due to elevated temperatures affecting productivity, altering disease outbreaks and increasing the risk of harmful algal blooms. An increase in the frequency of extreme weather conditions may impact on safety and increase the risk of damage and escapes.</p>

<p>In 2021, ICES received 7733 new and resubmitted records of vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicators and habitats in EU waters. These are located within the Celtic Seas ecoregion and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast ecoregion. The geographical positions of areas subject to various protection and fisheries management regimes are included in this advice. Any bottom fishing on VME habitats will cause damage to these habitats. </p>        <h3>OSPAR request to generate swept-area and abundance index outputs for all otter and beam trawl surveys in the Northeast Atlantic and regional seas based on DATRAS data as input to OSPAR common indicato</h3>
<p>ICES considers that the online database of scientific trawl surveys contained in DATRAS is a valuable resource and advises that it be used in biodiversity assessments and for the calculation of OSPAR common indicators FC1, FC2, FC3, and FW3 for the QSR 2023. ICES provides, as downloadable products, the code and data products requested by OSPAR to calculate swept-area for all relevant hauls in DATRAS surveys and to calculate annual estimates of abundance indices of 50 species or species groups in OSPAR regions II, III, and IV identified by ICES as sensitive. ICES considers that these estimates are currently the best available information for calculating OSPAR common indicators relating to the biodiversity of fish communities and the status of marine foodwebs. ICES notes that DATRAS is regularly updated with submissions from reporting national institutes. For new analyses or assessments, ICES advises that the latest updates of DATRAS be used when applying the codes provided in this advice. As ICES updates the swept area assessment outputs, these can be downloaded from DATRAS </p>
<h3>ICES VIEWPOINT: Assessment of the biological effects of chemical pollution for better management of the marine environment</h3>
<p>Chemical pollution is the introduction, through human activities, of chemical substances that have potential toxicity to marine organisms into the marine environment. Over the past several decades, the chemical environment of the seas has evolved as a result of these activities. There has been a continuous introduction of new substances and a general shift from high concentrations of a few chemicals to low concentrations of many. This situation is likely to persist in the future. The main groups of chemical pollutants that are of concern - trace metals and organic contaminants - have at least one of the following characteristics: they are persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic to marine organisms. There are several well documented examples of the impact of chemical pollutants on marine populations, at different trophic levels from invertebrates to marine mammals, via multiple mechanisms of toxicity. In addition, there is evidence of the sublethal effects of chemical pollution at the organismal level on biological functions, strongly linking to pathology and disease. The biological effects of chemical pollution need to be assessed directly, supporting the need for field based assessments. ICES advises to adopt the approach of biological effects methods for monitoring within the integrated chemical-biological monitoring and assessment framework as an absolute prerequisite for the provision of a holistic assessment of the impacts of pollution on marine ecosystems. ICES also recommends several measures for the effective implementation of field based biological effects methods. The new knowledge should be effectively brought into regulatory frameworks. </p>",,,,,
Brexit_Text,,"<H3>BREXIT IMPACTS ON FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, SCIENCE AND ADVICE</H3>
<p>On 1 January 2021 the UK left the EU. This had implications for Irish fisheries in terms of quota shares and access to UK waters. The UK's departure from the EU did not affect the ICES stock assessment process. </p>
<h3>Fisheries management </h3>
<p>In terms of fisheries management, the UK is now an independent 'Coastal State' that shares fisheries resources with the EU, similar to countries like Norway but with a much larger number of shared stocks. </p>
<p>The Trade and Cooperation Agreement<a href=""#footnote-1"">[1]</a> sets out the arrangements between the UK and EU on large number of areas, including fisheries. The agreement sets out changes to the TAC shares: the UK negotiated an increased share of the TAC for 61 stocks. This results in a commensurate reduction in the EU (and therefore Irish) share. For most stocks a transition period applies where 60% of the transition to the new shares occurred in 2021, to be followed by 70% in 2022, 80% in 2023 and 92% in 2024. By 2025, the transition to the new TAC shares will be complete. DAFM published a document<a href=""#footnote-2"">[2]</a> which outlines how the Irish shares of the TAC will change during the transition period.</p>
<p>Fishing opportunities (TACs) for EU stocks were historically established at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in December. Following the new agreement between the EU and the UK, TACs for the stocks which are jointly managed by the two parties are now established through annual consultations between both parties.  </p>
<p>The agreement also includes a licensing system for fishing vessels through which reciprocal access to each other's waters is granted. However, the detail of access is to be negotiated trough annual consultations. </p>
<h3>Science and advice </h3>
<p>The EU and UK have agreed to ensure that fishing activities for shared stocks are sustainably managed in line with the best available scientific advice.  The parties also agreed to ensure the continued collection and sharing of data relevant to stock assessment and fisheries management.</p>
<p>ICES membership is not limited to EU countries and the UK remains a full member of ICES. The UK's contribution to stock assessment working groups in terms of data and scientists has not changed. In terms of ICES catch advice, the only change is the way the 'headline' catch advice is formulated. In previous years, this advice was based on the EU Multi-Annual Plans<a href=""#footnote-3"">[3]</a> (EU MAPs) for stocks covered by these plans. Under the EU MAPs, TACs are set within a range around F<sub>MSY</sub> to allow increased flexibility in the management of these stocks. The ICES headline catch advice therefore included these ranges, where applicable. The EU MAPs no longer apply to the UK so for shared EU-UK stocks, the ICES headline advice no longer includes the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges but only the F<sub>MSY</sub> advice. However, the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges are still available in the catch options table of the relevant stocks. </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p id=""footnote-1"">[1]<a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/relations-non-eu-countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement_en"" target=""_blank"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/relations-non-eu-countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement_en</a></p>

AtSea2020,"<h3>Marine Institute At-Sea Sampling 2021 - including COVID-19 Response</h3><p>From March 2020 the Marine Institute (MI) at sea sampling aboard commercial vessels was temporarily suspended in the interest of the health and safety of both samplers and the fishing crews due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This temporary suspension remained in place for 2021 and therefore the MI have not had samplers at sea on commercial trips >18 hours during much of 2022 although normal sampling has resumed in the latter half of 2022. The MI were able to sample at sea on inshore vessels where overnight accommodation is not a requirement and sampling occurs outside on deck resulting in a number of at-sea trips. In 2022 the availability of vessels was reduced with a significant number availing of the tie-up schemes introduced after Brexit.</p>
<p>To mitigate for the loss of at sea sampler coverage the Marine Institute (MI) has worked with the industry and continued the at-sea self-sampling programme developed in 2020 where the skippers/crews collect data and samples from a subset of the hauls, bring the material ashore where MI staff measure and work up under COVID-19 guidelines. Each vessel is contacted individually by the Fisheries Liaison Team Leader (TL) following ""4s sampling""  guidelines selection in advance of a possible trip. On agreeing to participate the skipper is trained via remote training and supplied with a sampling pack pre sailing. Participating skippers record data on haul start & stop positions, date and time, estimate the bulk catch, record observations on bird, mammal, reptile interaction record by kg /species what catch is wanted and take one random box of unwanted catch for measurement ashore by our staff.  On sailing the participating skipper maintains contact with the Fisheries Liaison (TL) and quality assurance checks are performed regularly during the trip via WhatsApp. The extra samples coming ashore has resulted in an increased resource requirement ashore which is offset by the pandemic imposed lack of sea time. This mitigation measure has ensured that MI kept catch data flowing to our process systems and more importantly ensured that the dialogue between the MI and the industry is maintained and developed. This has resulted in over sixty demersal trips, 13 pelagic trips and 212 inshore/shellfish trips (inshore/shellfish is a combination of at sea sampler and self-sampling) sampled in 2021. </p><p>In 2020 the Marine Institute established up a self-sampling project with the Irish Tuna Fishery Improvement Project FIP (<a href=""http://www.irishtunafip.ie/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.irishtunafip.ie/</a>) where the Irish tuna fleet employed a crew member to self-sample data during the albacore fishery working to MI standard operating procedures. The crew member was trained by the MI and delivered the data to MI for entry/analysis. This program was continued in 2021 - 3 trips were sampled in in the Bay of Biscay during the season. The MI FU16 at-sea self-sampling programme to sample Porcupine <em>Nephrops</em> was continued and expanded in 2021 yielding 10 trips and associated samples.</p>
<p>The at-sea self-sampling programme was assessed and has resulted in several positive benefits; close collaboration and frequent communication with active fishermen, developing new self-sampling protocols, recruiting new vessels to the programme (including vessels with limited accommodation), increased understanding of the importance of scientific data collection and specific standards/SOPs. The MI aims to build on the partnerships developed with the industry through the at-sea self-sampling programme. In the future it is expected that the at-sea programme will take the form of dual streams for the collection of fisheries dependant data 1) from self-sampling and 2) from scientific samplers aboard vessels.</p>

<h3>At Sea Sampling </h3>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020 the Marine Institute at-sea-sampling programme aboard commercial vessels was suspended following public health guidelines and in the interest of the health and safety of both samplers and the fishing crews. This temporary suspension has remained since and therefore the Marine Institute have not had samplers at sea on commercial trips longer than 18 hours since then.  Following HSE advice as the lockdown restrictions were eased in the summer of 2020 the Marine Institute were able to reinstate at-sea-sampling programmes on inshore vessels where overnight accommodation was not a requirement and where sampling occurs outside on deck, resulting in a number of day trips. </p>
<p>To mitigate against the loss of at sea sampler coverage the Marine Institute has worked with the industry and developed an at-sea-self-sampling programme"" where the skippers/crews collect data and samples from a subset of the hauls, bringing the material ashore where Marine Institute staff measure and work up samples. Each vessel is contacted by the Fisheries Liaison team leader following ""4s sampling<a href=""#footnote-1"">[1]</a>"" selection procedures in advance of a possible trip. On agreeing to participate the skipper is remotely trained and supplied with a sampling pack before sailing. Participating skippers record data on haul positions, date and time, estimate of the bulk catch, observations on birds, mammals and reptile interaction as well as the weight of wanted catch by species. From the same haul they also take one random box of unwanted catch for measurement ashore by staff (Figure 1). The participating skipper maintains contact with the Fisheries Liaison team leader and quality assurance checks are performed during the trip via WhatsApp.  This mitigation measure has ensured that fisheries dependant data are available for stock assessments and importantly ensures that the dialogue between the Marine Institute and the industry is maintained and developed. The ""at-sea-self-sampling programme"" has resulted in over forty trips sampled in 2020 and continues to yield data in 2021. </p><p>In 2020 the Marine Institute also set up a self-sampling project with the Irish Tuna Fishery Improvement Project (<a href=""http://www.irishtunafip.ie/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.irishtunafip.ie/</a>) where the Irish tuna fleet employed a crew member to self sample data during the albacore fishery working to Marine Institute standard operating procedures. The crew member was trained by the Marine Institute and delivered the data to Marine Institute for entry/analysis. Whilst this was successful,  only 4 trips were sampled in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. It is hoped to build on this in the coming seasons. The Marine Institute also developed a new FU16 ""at-sea-self-sampling programme"" to sample <em>Nephrops</em>.  Measuring <em>Nephrops</em> at sea was suspended in March 2020 and as the fleet grade and freeze the <em>Nephrops</em> catch at sea an alternative sampling programme was needed. A number of vessels undertook this new sampling in Quarter 4 2020 and the programme has continued to expand in 2021. </p><p>For 2021 and 2022 the Marine Institute approach to the at-sea-self-sampling will firstly be influenced by HSE COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines.  Whilst under COVID-19 restrictions the Marine Institute hopes to expand the at-sea-self-sampling programme by modifying and developing new protocols and recruiting new vessels to the programme. The beam trawl fleet is underrepresented in this programme and the aim is to increase the dialogue with beam trawl vessel owners to mitigate this. The Marine Institute aims to build on the partnerships developed with the at-sea-self-sampling programme and hope that these will translate to fishers accommodating samplers aboard their vessels when it safe to do so in the future. The at-sea-self-sampling mitigation measure will be re-assessed post COVID-19 to assess the feasibility of developing a dual stream of fisheries dependant data <ol><li> from self sampling and </li><li> from samplers aboard vessels.</li></ol> This approach may also facilitate an increase in vessel availability as the at-sea-self-sampling programme is not limited by accommodation aboard vessels. </p><p>While COVID-19 restrictions have curtailed the Marine Institute at-sea-sampling it has also afforded the opportunity to trial new methods of collecting fisheries dependant data at-sea for the Irish fleet. The at-sea-self-sampling programme has brought participating skippers closer to the scientific process and has increased the understanding of the importance of collecting data at sea to specific standards/SOPs. </p><h3>Onshore Port Sampling </h3><p>Port sampling in 2020 and 2021 was also affected by the COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines. Many port based sampling facilities were restricted to immediate staff. Some locations facilitated sampling by Marine Institute staff working out of hours to minimise potential contact with others. In other locations sampling was not permissible and alternative arrangements to purchase fish samples were introduced in an effort to plug the emerging data gap. The supply of fish for sampling was affected by the COVID-19 as fishers reacted to shifts in the markets resulting in reduced sampling opportunities,  as fishers responded to reduced demand and decreasing prices. Sampling was also affected by staff availability due to the requirements to isolate or minimise contacts prior to surveys on the research vessels and also due to HSE close contact guidelines.</p><p>Only one Marine Institute fisheries research survey was cancelled since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 blue whiting survey was cancelled in March 2020 due to the inability of other international research vessels to participate in the survey and it was not possible for the Marine Institute to cover the survey area alone. All other surveys were carried out under strict COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines with modified survey protocols where necessary.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p id=""footnote-1"">[1]This is a statistically sound sampling programme which is described further here <a href=""https://www.dcmap-ireland.ie/documents/methodologies"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dcmap-ireland.ie/documents/methodologies</a></p>"," <p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p id=""footnote-1"">[1]This is a statistically sound sampling programme which is described further here <a href=""https://www.dcmapireland.
