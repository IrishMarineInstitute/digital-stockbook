Brexit_Text,"<H3>BREXIT IMPACTS ON FISHERIES MANAGEMENT, SCIENCE AND ADVICE</H3>
<p>On 1 January 2021 the UK left the EU. This had implications for Irish fisheries in terms of quota shares and access to UK waters. The UK's departure from the EU did not affect the ICES stock assessment process. </p>
<h3>Fisheries management </h3>
<p>In terms of fisheries management, the UK is now an independent 'Coastal State' that shares fisheries resources with the EU, similar to countries like Norway but with a much larger number of shared stocks. </p>
<p>The Trade and Cooperation Agreement<a href=""#footnote-1"">[1]</a> sets out the arrangements between the UK and EU on large number of areas, including fisheries. The agreement sets out changes to the TAC shares: the UK negotiated an increased share of the TAC for 61 stocks. This results in a commensurate reduction in the EU (and therefore Irish) share. For most stocks a transition period applies where 60% of the transition to the new shares occurred in 2021, to be followed by 70% in 2022, 80% in 2023 and 92% in 2024. By 2025, the transition to the new TAC shares will be complete. DAFM published a document<a href=""#footnote-2"">[2]</a> which outlines how the Irish shares of the TAC will change during the transition period.</p>
<p>Fishing opportunities (TACs) for EU stocks were historically established at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in December. Following the new agreement between the EU and the UK, TACs for the stocks which are jointly managed by the two parties are now established through annual consultations between both parties.  </p>
<p>The agreement also includes a licensing system for fishing vessels through which reciprocal access to each other's waters is granted. However, the detail of access is to be negotiated trough annual consultations. </p>
<h3>Science and advice </h3>
<p>The EU and UK have agreed to ensure that fishing activities for shared stocks are sustainably managed in line with the best available scientific advice.  The parties also agreed to ensure the continued collection and sharing of data relevant to stock assessment and fisheries management.</p>
<p>ICES membership is not limited to EU countries and the UK remains a full member of ICES. The UK's contribution to stock assessment working groups in terms of data and scientists has not changed. In terms of ICES catch advice, the only change is the way the 'headline' catch advice is formulated. In previous years, this advice was based on the EU Multi-Annual Plans<a href=""#footnote-3"">[3]</a> (EU MAPs) for stocks covered by these plans. Under the EU MAPs, TACs are set within a range around F<sub>MSY</sub> to allow increased flexibility in the management of these stocks. The ICES headline catch advice therefore included these ranges, where applicable. The EU MAPs no longer apply to the UK so for shared EU-UK stocks, the ICES headline advice no longer includes the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges but only the F<sub>MSY</sub> advice. However, the F<sub>MSY</sub> ranges are still available in the catch options table of the relevant stocks. </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p id=""footnote-1"">[1]<a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/relations-non-eu-countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-andcooperation-

AtSea2020,"<h3>MARINE INSTITUTE SAMPLING - COVID-19 RESPONSE</h3>
<h3>At Sea Sampling </h3>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020 the Marine Institute at-sea-sampling programme aboard commercial vessels was suspended following public health guidelines and in the interest of the health and safety of both samplers and the fishing crews. This temporary suspension has remained since and therefore the Marine Institute have not had samplers at sea on commercial trips longer than 18 hours since then.  Following HSE advice as the lockdown restrictions were eased in the summer of 2020 the Marine Institute were able to reinstate at-sea-sampling programmes on inshore vessels where overnight accommodation was not a requirement and where sampling occurs outside on deck, resulting in a number of day trips. </p>
<p>To mitigate against the loss of at sea sampler coverage the Marine Institute has worked with the industry and developed an at-sea-self-sampling programme"" where the skippers/crews collect data and samples from a subset of the hauls, bringing the material ashore where Marine Institute staff measure and work up samples. Each vessel is contacted by the Fisheries Liaison team leader following ""4s sampling<a href=""#footnote-1"">[1]</a>"" selection procedures in advance of a possible trip. On agreeing to participate the skipper is remotely trained and supplied with a sampling pack before sailing. Participating skippers record data on haul positions, date and time, estimate of the bulk catch, observations on birds, mammals and reptile interaction as well as the weight of wanted catch by species. From the same haul they also take one random box of unwanted catch for measurement ashore by staff (Figure 1). The participating skipper maintains contact with the Fisheries Liaison team leader and quality assurance checks are performed during the trip via WhatsApp.  This mitigation measure has ensured that fisheries dependant data are available for stock assessments and importantly ensures that the dialogue between the Marine Institute and the industry is maintained and developed. The ""at-sea-self-sampling programme"" has resulted in over forty trips sampled in 2020 and continues to yield data in 2021. </p><p>In 2020 the Marine Institute also set up a self-sampling project with the Irish Tuna Fishery Improvement Project (<a href=""http://www.irishtunafip.ie/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.irishtunafip.ie/</a>) where the Irish tuna fleet employed a crew member to self sample data during the albacore fishery working to Marine Institute standard operating procedures. The crew member was trained by the Marine Institute and delivered the data to Marine Institute for entry/analysis. Whilst this was successful,  only 4 trips were sampled in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. It is hoped to build on this in the coming seasons. The Marine Institute also developed a new FU16 ""at-sea-self-sampling programme"" to sample <em>Nephrops</em>.  Measuring <em>Nephrops</em> at sea was suspended in March 2020 and as the fleet grade and freeze the <em>Nephrops</em> catch at sea an alternative sampling programme was needed. A number of vessels undertook this new sampling in Quarter 4 2020 and the programme has continued to expand in 2021. </p><p>For 2021 and 2022 the Marine Institute approach to the at-sea-self-sampling will firstly be influenced by HSE COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines.  Whilst under COVID-19 restrictions the Marine Institute hopes to expand the at-sea-self-sampling programme by modifying and developing new protocols and recruiting new vessels to the programme. The beam trawl fleet is underrepresented in this programme and the aim is to increase the dialogue with beam trawl vessel owners to mitigate this. The Marine Institute aims to build on the partnerships developed with the at-sea-self-sampling programme and hope that these will translate to fishers accommodating samplers aboard their vessels when it safe to do so in the future. The at-sea-self-sampling mitigation measure will be re-assessed post COVID-19 to assess the feasibility of developing a dual stream of fisheries dependant data <ol><li> from self sampling and </li><li> from samplers aboard vessels.</li></ol> This approach may also facilitate an increase in vessel availability as the at-sea-self-sampling programme is not limited by accommodation aboard vessels. </p><p>While COVID-19 restrictions have curtailed the Marine Institute at-sea-sampling it has also afforded the opportunity to trial new methods of collecting fisheries dependant data at-sea for the Irish fleet. The at-sea-self-sampling programme has brought participating skippers closer to the scientific process and has increased the understanding of the importance of collecting data at sea to specific standards/SOPs. </p><h3>Onshore Port Sampling </h3><p>Port sampling in 2020 and 2021 was also affected by the COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines. Many port based sampling facilities were restricted to immediate staff. Some locations facilitated sampling by Marine Institute staff working out of hours to minimise potential contact with others. In other locations sampling was not permissible and alternative arrangements to purchase fish samples were introduced in an effort to plug the emerging data gap. The supply of fish for sampling was affected by the COVID-19 as fishers reacted to shifts in the markets resulting in reduced sampling opportunities,  as fishers responded to reduced demand and decreasing prices. Sampling was also affected by staff availability due to the requirements to isolate or minimise contacts prior to surveys on the research vessels and also due to HSE close contact guidelines.</p><p>Only one Marine Institute fisheries research survey was cancelled since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 blue whiting survey was cancelled in March 2020 due to the inability of other international research vessels to participate in the survey and it was not possible for the Marine Institute to cover the survey area alone. All other surveys were carried out under strict COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines with modified survey protocols where necessary.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p id=""footnote-1"">[1]This is a statistically sound sampling programme which is described further here <a href=""https://www.dcmapireland.
