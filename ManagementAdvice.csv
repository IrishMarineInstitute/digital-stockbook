This plan includes various conservation measures, including a TAC together with extended time/area closures and minimum size. Management measures to reduce fishing mortality were introduced in 2008. These measures included lower TACs, increased control and enforcement measures, particularly within the Mediterranean Sea, and a requirement for all purse seine vessels targeting Bluefin tuna for farming in cages to carry observers on-board.

Therefore the MSE will not be completed in time for the 2020 Commission meeting to provide TAC advice for 2021-2023 and accordingly, the Committee recommended extending the MSE process for another year.</li> <li>Ireland has no target fisheries. Bycatches in any fishery are subject to an unallocated bycatch quota for EU vessels (61.69 t in 2019). This bycatch allowance may be very restrictive as the stock rebuilds.</li> <li> A recommendation to consider moving from a rebuilding to a management plan has been made. The Marine Institute commenced a research programme on Bluefin tuna in 2016 in partnership with Stanford University USA, University of Acadia Canada, Trinity College Dublin and ICCAT. A total of 56 Bluefin Tuna were tagged with pop off satellite tags (50) and accelerometer tags (6) from the Donegal coast during years 2016, 2017 and 2018. Results suggest a very high survival rate of tagged fish. Tags recovered to date show that fish tend to migrate to the mid-Atlantic for overwintering with some passing through the Bay of Biscay. Several fish have been observed in the Mediterranean at spawning time before subsequently returning to Irish waters a year later. Under the continuing research programme, the Marine institute and partners plan to apply up to 30 satellite tags and 5 accelerometer tags to Bluefin tuna in 2019.</li> <li> A new management plan for Bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic, proposed by the ICCAT in 2018 allows for countries with no assigned quota to set up a recreational /sport catch/conventional tag/release fishery. This allows member states to collect scientific data regarding the numbers of BFT in particular areas and their migratory habits. Specifically: <ul><li> Vessels would require specific authorisations <li> Vessels must be operating in the context of a scientific project of a research institute integrated in a scientific research programme. <li> Results would also need to be communicated to the Standing Committee on Research and Science (SCRS of ICCAT) on a yearly basis. <li> Tagging must be performed by trained personnel.</li></ul> <li> In 2019, DAFM announced that applications were being sought from angling vessel owners to participate in this catch and release data collection fishery. 15 vessels made successful applications and were provided with authorisations to catch and release Bluefin tuna in Irish waters. All vessel owners were obliged to attend training provided by the Marine Institute, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. The season was opened for the first time on the 15th of August with a closing date of the 15th of October. Following consultations with DAFM, DCCAE, Marine Institute, IFI and SFPA the season was extended to the 12th of November 2019. Tagging with conventional tags was carried out on fish taken alongside the vessel before their release and no fish are allowed to be landed. All fishery data required by ICCAT are being collected by the Marine Institute. Up to the end of October 2019, approximately 200 BFT had been tagged.</li><li>Further information on this stock can be found in the 2018 Stock Book</li></ul>"
