600 m. The species is widely distributed from Norway to Senegal, including the
Mediterranean and oceanic island waters, but mostly south of Ireland to north Spain.
Boarfish recruit to the fishery around three to four years of age, although the
maximum age of boarfish is about 30. Spawning occurs on the Celtic Sea shelf edge
during June and July. Under optimal conditions, boarfish are capable of spawning over
an extended period of time. Maturation occurs at 3.5 years, corresponding to a total
length of approximately 10 cm. The maximum size of this species is about 18 cm.

The target level of exploitation is calculated according to the spawning-stock biomass (SSB) in the first year of the forecast as follows: - if SSB < Bpa, then Ftr = SSB / Bpa x FMSY; - if Bpa <= SSB <= 2 x Bpa, then Ftr = FMSY; - if 2 x Bpa < SSB < 3 x Bpa, then Ftr = FMSY x (1 + 0.5 x (SSB - 2 x Bpa) / Bpa); - if SSB >= 3 x Bpa, then Ftr = 1.5 x FMSY; where FMSY = 0.40 and Bpa = 460 000 tonnes. If the spawning-stock biomass in the present year, the previous year, and each of the three years of prediction is above Bpa, the TAC should not be changed by more than ±20% compared with the previous year's TAC. In this case, Ftr should however not be below 0.30.

a) if it is necessary for the achievement of objectives of mixed fisheries;

Herring migrate to distant feeding grounds and are often found in mixed aggregations with other herring stocks. Their diet consists largely of zooplankton, mainly copepods. Fish reach a total length of between 28 and 37 cm, depending on the stock. Herring are important prey for marine mammals, birds and many predatory fish. Unusually for a marine fish, eggs are deposited on the bottom in discrete gravel beds. Herring eggs are also consumed by some gadoid species. In the waters around Ireland the main spawning grounds for herring are off the Donegal and Mayo coasts, and inshore along the south and west coast including Dunmore East and Cork Harbour. Herring reach full maturity by ages 2 or 3. They are not particularly fecund compared to other pelagic fish.","On average approximately 11,500 tonnes of herring were caught and landed by Irish vessels using mainly pelagic trawls annually between 2017 and 2019.

seabed. They feed primarily at night on small crustaceans, worms and bivalve molluscs.
In common with many flatfish, sole are fast growing as juveniles, slowing down as they
mature. Females grow larger than the males. They can reach lengths of up to 70cm or
weights of up to 3kg. Sole are quite solitary marine and estuarine fish, and the local
environment may contribute to variable growth rates.</p>
<p>Females reach maturity at around 3 years when they are around  25-30cm long. An average mature female can produce in the
region of 150,000 - 200,000 eggs a year. They spawn in spring and early summer.Juveniles (<3 years) are
found in coastal nurseries before they move in to deeper waters.</p>","The annual landings of sole by Irish vessels were approximately 165 tonnes in the last 3 years, 47% of which were caught in 7.j. In 2019 landings were worth around €2.1 million for Irish vessels. ","On average approximately 185 tonnes of sole annually were caught and landed in mixed demersal fisheries by Irish vessels between 2016 and 2018, 50% of which were caught in 7.j.

shown that adults can migrate over considerable distances, indicating at least some exchange between the
Norwegian coast, Faroe and Iceland. Survey data show that density in the north eastern North Sea is markedly
higher during summer than during winter, suggesting dispersal during the feeding season.</p>

sai-7,pok.27.7,Saithe,Subarea 7 (West Of Ireland And Celtic Sea)    ,126441,Pollachius virens,POK,Saithe,Demersal,"Saithe is a large Gadoid, reaching maximum size of 130cm. It is a cold-water species distributed throughout the
northern Atlantic. Saithe live in shoals and occur close to the bottom, in midwater and even near the surface.
Juveniles occur mostly in coastal waters while older fish move to deeper waters. Tagging experiments have
shown that adults can migrate over considerable distances, indicating at least some exchange between the
Norwegian coast, Faroe and Iceland. Survey data show that density in the north eastern North Sea is markedly
higher during summer than during winter, suggesting dispersal during the feeding season.
Saithe feed primarily on pelagic organisms. Krill is the most important food for young fish, but is also consumed
by larger individuals. Larger fish mainly feed on capelin, sandeels and other fish species.
Growth is quite rapid and the saithe reach sexual maturity at the age of 5 or 6 years. The minimum conservation reference size is 35cm.","Landings of saithe have declined in recent years with 276 t caught in 2019 which was worth approximately €320,000 for Irish vessels.  Saithe are mainly caught in mixed demersal fisheries by Irish vessels. Between 2017 and 2019 35% were caught in 7.g and 27% were caught in 7.j.  ","On average approximately 772 tonnes of saithe annualy were landed in mixed demersal fisheries by Irish vessels between 2016 and 2018. 40% of which were caught in 7.g and 26% caught in 7.j.

mate. The eggs take about 4-8 weeks to develop into juveniles depending on

Ireland has no target fisheries and by-catches in pelagic fisheries are subject to an unallocated bycatch quota for EU vessels (32.97 t in 2015). This by-catch allowance may be very restrictive as the stock rebuilds.

Such a strategy should contain adequate provision for unavoidable by-catch in non-target fisheries.

This stock has been subject to the landing obligation since 1 January 2015. There is no proposed quota uplift as ICCAT considers discards to be negligible.

A rebuilding plan has been in place for this stock since 2006.

Landing of bycatch should be part of a management plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fisheries. 

Based on medium-term projections, annual catches at the recent assumed level (2,468 t) would allow the stock to increase at a rate close to that estimated with zero catches; therefore ICES considers that bycatch should not exceed that level.

In a response to the EC on the removal of TACs for certain stocks ICES advises that removing the EU TAC for spurdog may generate a high risk of the stocks being exploited unsustainably.
