Fish reach a total length of between 28 and 37 cm, depending on the stock. Herring are important prey for marine mammals, birds and many predatory fish. Unusually for a marine fish, eggs are deposited on the bottom in discrete gravel beds. Herring eggs are also consumed by some gadoid species. In the waters around Ireland the main spawning grounds for herring are off the Donegal and Mayo coasts, and inshore along the south and west coast including Dunmore East and Cork Harbour.

ALB-N,ALB-N,,Albacore Tuna,North Atlantic,,,ALB,,Pelagic,"Albacore is a medium sized, pelagic fish found offshore, in surface and mid waters between 14 &deg and 21 &deg Celsius. It is found from the Azores and Canaries north to Ireland, and westwards to the central USA. Separate stocks occur in the south Atlantic and the Mediterranean. It is fast growing and recruits to the fishery by age 1, with maximum age of 15 years. Maturation occurs at 5 years, corresponding to fork length of approximately 90 cm, and maximum size is 128 cm. Juveniles migrate north to SW Ireland in summer, to feed in surface waters. Adults migrate, at depths from 50-150 m, to spawn off Venezuela, in the Gulf of Mexico and Sargasso Sea. Spawning ensues from April to September.","Irish catches of Albacore tuna in recent years been around 3,100 t (average 2020-2022). The majority of catches was taken by pelagic pair trawl. Since 2017, the bulk of catches have been from ICES division 8 (Bay of Biscay) and landed into France and Spain. Previous to this, the majority of catch was taken in the Celtic Sea.

BFT-E,BFT-E,,Bluefin Tuna,East Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea,,,BFT,,Pelagic,"Bluefin tuna is the largest tuna, and one of the largest fish of all. It is a pelagic, fish-eating species, found from the surface to depths of up to 1,000 m, and in temperatures from 3&deg to 30&deg Celsius. It is found throughout the Mediterranean and north Atlantic extending to the very cold waters off Norway. A separate stock occurs in the western north Atlantic. It is fast growing and recruits to the fishery by age 1, with maximum age of at least 20 years. Maturation occurs at 4 years, corresponding to fork length of approximately 115 cm, and maximum size is 400 cm. Juveniles migrate north to SW Ireland in summer, to feed in surface waters. Adults migrate, at depths from 50-150 m, to spawn off Venezuela, in the Gulf of Mexico and Sargasso Sea, and in the Mediterranean Sea. Spawning occurs from May to June, but individuals may only spawn every 2-3 years. Bluefin tuna are highly opportunistic predators that feed primarily on schooling fish. While they do eat pelagic shoaling fish such as herring and mackerel, there is no evidence that they specifically target them.","Ireland has no directed fishery for bluefin tuna. In 2022, 20 t of bluefin tuna were caught and landed by Irish vessels as bycatch (mainly in the albacore fishery) for which there is a minor quota.

The species is widely distributed from Morocco to the South of Norway and four different stocks are identified in European waters. ICES has considered sprat in the Celtic Seas Ecoregion (ICES Divisions 6 and 7 excluding 7.d & 7.e) to be one stock since 2011. There is work ongoing to investigate stock structure and dynamics within the area. Sprat perform seasonal migrations between winter-feeding and summer spawning grounds as well as diel vertical migrations. Sprat reach a total length of 18 cm, size-at-maturity has been estimated at 10.1 cm and is highly variable between areas. Spawning occurs in shallow waters (10-20 m) and egg production ranges 6,000-14,000. There is currently no evidence of spawning site fidelity (homing). European sprat is an important species in the trophic web as it links between zooplankton and top predators (fish, birds and marine mammals).","The average annual catch of sprat in the past 3 years (2020-2022) was 12,400 t.
